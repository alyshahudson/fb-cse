Don\'t you think that started the division? He hadn\'t even been president yet, and EXCEPT for Clinton and Obama, not one democrat showed up....Is that when Trump divided America? Can you imagine if the REPUBLICANS didn\'t show up for Obama\'s inauguration because they lost??? Can you even start to imagine what would have happened?\n\nHow about when 19 minutes after Trump was inaugurated, the Washington Post declared the IMPEACHMENT CAMPAIGN has STARTED? Was that when Trump divided America?\nHow about when Nancy Pelosi ripped up Trump\'s state of the union right in front of the world, showing complete disrespect for the president of the United States? Did that bring the country together and is THAT when Trump divided America?\nHow about when America had to endure, 3 years and over 30 million dollars spent on trying to PROVE that Trump only won because of RUSSIAN COLLUSION and NOT because America voted him in and 17 democrats did EVERYTHING in their power to PROVE that there was Russian Collusion...and came up with ZERO...?\n\nWas THAT when Trump divided America?\nI can\'t even start to go over the NEGATIVE PRESS he\'s received since his surprise win...\nRemember, the DONORS, the likes Bloomberg, who gave 27 million, Tom Steyer who gave 17 million, George Soros who gave 9 million and MANY MORE that gave MULTI-MILLIONS to Hillary, wanted a return on their investment...\nDo you really think that donors give MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS just because they love Hillary?\nNO, these weren\'t campaign donations, they were INVESTMENTS into what HILLARY had promised them when she became president....\nThey were so sure she would win and they would be SHOWERED with HUGE RETURNS, and when it didn\'t happen and they LOST all those millions, they went all out to TAKE TRUMP out of OFFICE by any means possible...\nDID YOU KNOW that 90% of the Mainstream media and the corporations that own them, are owned by or run by BIG DEMOCRAT DONORS? You can verify all of that for yourselves...I did...\nSince the moment Trump won, even before he was inaugurated, the mainstream media\'s reporting was 92% negative on Trump, do you know why?\nIt was those big donors that lost their dream of MILLIONS of dollars, on their returns that they were going to receive win Hillary was president and they weren\'t going to take that loss lightly...They needed to PUNISH TRUMP and those that VOTED HIM IN...\nI\'ve said this since the night he was elected...\n""There is NOTHING the left won\'t do to take down our President‚Äù, our country and us, no low they won\'t go to, to get their power back"", and sadly, we have seen this every single day since his election.\nLet me ask you this...Have you ever listened to Trump or appreciated any accomplishment or campaign promises he\'s kept, have you ever gone to one of his rallies or have you just closed your mind to ANYTHING he does?\nPlease ask yourselves the following questions, if you dare...\nWhat has Joe Biden done for America for the last 47 years that he\'s held an office?\nWhat did Joe Biden ever do for BLACKS when HE and Obama were in office?\nWhat has Joe Biden ever done in his entire life to create a private-sector job?\nWhat has Joe Biden done to help the American middle class worker?\nLet me also ask you this...Why do you think there are so many people tearing down statues, our burning flag, beating up police officers, disrespecting our founders and hating our country?\nIt comes straight from our SCHOOLS that have slowly been tearing down our history...\nIf there is a teacher out there, please tell me the following:\nDo you teach the truth that it was the DEMOCRATS that:\nWere the KKK?\nThat the GRAND LEADER of the KKK was Robert Byrd, who was elected to congress and served for decades, and that it was Hillary, Bill, and Obama that gave his EULOGY praising him?\nThat the DEMOCRATS fought the Civil war to KEEP SLAVERY?\nThat the inner-city ghettoes were created by DEMOCRATS to keep control of slaves after they were freed?\nThat planned parenthood was founded in inner cities to CONTROL the BLACK POPULATION?\nIs any of this in your history books?

Were there reporters even reporting it...NO! Just look at the difference in the reporting. By the way, since Trump\'s been in office he\'s commuted 10 people...compare that to Obama...Is that reporting fair?\nHow about when Biden and Obama allowed the H1N1, the SWINE FLU, to INFECT MILLIONS of Americans before declaring it a health emergency....\nWas the press losing it\'s minds and calling it the OBAMAFLU AND BLAMING OBAMA and BIDEN for the spread ? SILENCE!\nCompare this to the NEGATIVE COVERAGE that Trump got when, he immediately halted travel from China when, in February, Nancy Pelosi went to Chinatown and said come on down, or when DeBlasio, in March, said ride the subways and go to broadway...BUT those same people are blaming Trump for the spread of coronavirus..\nA FINAL QUESTION:\nWhat have the DEMOCRATS done to help make America the best, to get behind a president that works tirelessly to care about WE THE PEOPLE instead of using us as political pawns..\nWhat have the democrats done for people of color EXCEPT for GIVING ILLEGALS more rights than citizens and having us pay for it...\nJUST imagine what this country could accomplish if the Democrats worked with him on the economy, the coronavirus, the inner cities where he\'s created opportunity zones, job training etc.\nWhen Trump tried to get school choice for inner-city students they ran Betsy Devoss out!! The dems running those innercity schools wanted no part of school choice.\nHave you ever wondered why it\'s cities that have been run, for decades, that have the MOST HOMELESS, the MOST CRIME, the most MURDERS, the worst INNER CITY schools, ARE ALL RUN BY DEMOCRATS???\nIf you haven\'t started asking yourselves those questions, maybe you should..\nAs I said, my entire family used to be democrats, but NOT ONE will ever vote for a democrat again....They asked themselves the same questions and the answer was clear....\n\nCopied and pasted.', ""I know plenty of common sense Democrats who have become Republicans and Democrats who are voting for President Trump.

You can verify all of that for yourselves...I did...\nSince the moment Trump won, even before he was inaugurated, the mainstream media\'s reporting was 92% negative on Trump, do you know why?\nIt was those big donors that lost their dream of MILLIONS of dollars, on their returns that they were going to receive win Hillary was president and they weren\'t going to take that loss lightly...They needed to PUNISH TRUMP and those that VOTED HIM IN...\nI\'ve said this since the night he was elected...\n""There is NOTHING the left won\'t do to take down our President‚Äù, our country and us, no low they won\'t go to, to get their power back"", and sadly, we have seen this every single day since his election.\nLet me ask you this...Have you ever listened to Trump or appreciated any accomplishment or campaign promises he\'s kept, have you ever gone to one of his rallies or have you just closed your mind to ANYTHING he does?\nPlease ask yourselves the following questions, if you dare...\nWhat has Joe Biden done for America for the last 47 years that he\'s held an office?\nWhat did Joe Biden ever do for BLACKS when HE and Obama were in office?\nWhat has Joe Biden ever done in his entire life to create a private-sector job?\nWhat has Joe Biden done to help the American middle class worker?\nLet me also ask you this...\nWhy do you think there are so many people tearing down statues, our burning flag, beating up police officers, disrespecting our founders and hating our country?\nIt comes straight from our SCHOOLS that have slowly been tearing down our history...\nIf there is a teacher out there, please tell me the following:\nDo you teach the truth that it was the DEMOCRATS that:\nWere the KKK?\nThat the GRAND LEADER of the KKK was Robert Byrd, who was elected to congress and served for decades, and that it was Hillary, Bill, and Obama that gave his EULOGY praising him?\nThat the DEMOCRATS fought the Civil war to KEEP SLAVERY?\nThat the inner-city ghettoes were created by DEMOCRATS to keep control of slaves after they were freed?\nThat planned parenthood was founded in inner cities to CONTROL the BLACK POPULATION?\nIs any of this in your history books? Let me ask you this as well.\nCan a student speak up when he/she disagrees with a teacher when they say that Trump is a horrible president or the electoral college has to be eliminated? Don\'t think so?\nWell, I know a student that actually happened to...When the teacher said it had to be eliminated because Hillary lost, and he stated the reason it should stay,\nShe ripped him apart and gave the entire class a 5 hour test, and stated it was because he DARED to disagree with her...\nIs that happening in your schools?\nI\'m only asking questions....I\'d like your answers..\nPresident Trump and his entire family has been vilified, demeaned and disrespected, for one reason and one reason only.......HE WON...\nHave you noticed the DEMOCRATS only throw tantrums and OBJECT to everything he does and have NEVER ONCE gotten behind him to make America the best it can be?\nWHY? They can\'t afford to get behind him...he would WIN AGAIN, and they can\'t let that happen....if he wins again, the Democrat party will be destroyed and they know it...\nDid you notice that the ""CAGES"" the left claimed that Trump built to put Illegal children in, WERE BUILT BY OBAMA for the very purpose of PUTTING ILLEGAL CHILDREN IN?\nWas THAT all over the news when Obama did it? The very same ""CAGES""...but the media was silent!!\nHow about when Trump commuted Roger Stone\'s sentence,and was DEMONIZED 24/7 but NOT A WORD when Obama commuted 1715 inmates, which included 330 that he granted on his last day in office...\nDID WE EVEN HEAR one WORD about it? Were there reporters even reporting it...NO! Just look at the difference in the reporting. By the way, since Trump\'s been in office he\'s commuted 10 people...compare that to Obama...Is that reporting fair?\nHow about when Biden and Obama allowed the H1N1, the SWINE FLU, to INFECT MILLIONS of Americans before declaring it a health emergency....\nWas the press losing it\'s minds and calling it the OBAMAFLU AND BLAMING OBAMA and BIDEN for the spread ? SILENCE!\nCompare this to the NEGATIVE COVERAGE that Trump got when, he immediately halted travel from China when, in February, Nancy Pelosi went to Chinatown and said come on down, or when DeBlasio, in March, said ride the subways and go to broadway...BUT those same people are blaming Trump for the spread of coronavirus..\nA FINAL QUESTION:\nWhat have the DEMOCRATS done to help make America the best, to get behind a president that works tirelessly to care about WE THE PEOPLE instead of using us as political pawns..\nWhat have the democrats done for people of color EXCEPT for GIVING ILLEGALS more rights than citizens and having us pay for it...\nJUST imagine what this country could accomplish if the Democrats worked with him on the economy, the coronavirus, the inner cities where he\'s created opportunity zones, job training etc.\nWhen Trump tried to get school choice for inner-city students they ran Betsy Devoss out!! The dems running those innercity schools wanted no part of school choice.\nHave you ever wondered why it\'s cities that have been run, for decades, that have the MOST HOMELESS, the MOST CRIME, the most MURDERS, the worst INNER CITY schools, \nARE ALL RUN BY DEMOCRATS???\nIf you haven\'t started asking yourselves those questions, maybe you should..\nAs I said, my entire family used to be democrats, but NOT ONE will ever vote for a democrat again....\nThey asked themselves the same questions and the answer was clear.', 'Keith F.

My oldest brother is on the spectrum (autism), and I have a brother-in-law who is dyslexic; he can barely write. I also volunteer with autistic and disable children so I\'m somewhat knowledgeable on the subject. Yes, there have been employers who have taken advantage of their disabilities, but I can assure you both have not been paid minimum wage since working part-time in high school, and even then, I wonder because one was working on the tobacco farms. Both have learned to speak up for themselves. I\'m agreeing with you in that we should not let the employers tell us what we are worth. But, they do have a say in evaluating that process. I can say I\'m worth $500K all day long, but if I can\'t perform the tasks required to support that, then the employer absolutely will share their thoughts on my value to them.

I would have no problem telling them that I'm worth more. I would tell them why I'm worth more and if they didn't budge then I would move on. Before COVID restrictions were in place, our unemployment in this state was at an all-time low. That meant it was an employees market. There was more work than there were people. As businesses start opening up now, that same philosophy applies. That said, people shouldn't be greedy by overvaluing themselves.  An employer can always go up in pay. Almost none go backward in pay. So, those who oversell their ability find themselves out of a job. Everyone has the right to negotiate their pay rate.

Don\'t you think that started the division? He hadn\'t even been president yet, and EXCEPT for Clinton and Obama, not one democrat showed up....Is that when Trump divided America? Can you imagine if the REPUBLICANS didn\'t show up for Obama\'s inauguration because they lost??? Can you even start to imagine what would have happened?\nHow about when 19 minutes after Trump was inaugurated, the Washington Post declared the IMPEACHMENT CAMPAIGN has STARTED? Was that when Trump divided America?\nHow about when Nancy Pelosi ripped up Trump\'s state of the union right in front of the world, showing complete disrespect for the president of the United States? Did that bring the country together and is THAT when Trump divided America?\nHow about when America had to endure, 3 years and over 30 million dollars spent on trying to PROVE that Trump only won because of RUSSIAN COLLUSION and NOT because America voted him in and 17 democrats did EVERYTHING in their power to PROVE that there was Russian Collusion...and came up with ZERO...?\nWas THAT when Trump divided America?\nI can\'t even start to go over the NEGATIVE PRESS he\'s received since his surprise win...\nRemember, the DONORS, the likes Bloomberg, who gave 27 million, Tom Steyer who gave 17 million, George Soros who gave 9 million and MANY MORE that gave MULTI-MILLIONS to Hillary, wanted a return on their investment...\nDo you really think that donors give MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS just because they love Hillary?\nNO, these weren\'t campaign donations, they were INVESTMENTS into what HILLARY had promised them when she became president....\nThey were so sure she would win and they would be SHOWERED with HUGE RETURNS, and when it didn\'t happen and they LOST all those millions, they went all out to TAKE TRUMP out of OFFICE by any means possible...\nDID YOU KNOW that 90% of the Mainstream media and the corporations that own them, are owned by or run by BIG DEMOCRAT DONORS? You can verify all of that for yourselves...I did...\nSince the moment Trump won, even before he was inaugurated, the mainstream media\'s reporting was 92% negative on Trump, do you know why?\nIt was those big donors that lost their dream of MILLIONS of dollars, on their returns that they were going to receive win Hillary was president and they weren\'t going to take that loss lightly...They needed to PUNISH TRUMP and those that VOTED HIM IN...\nI\'ve said this since the night he was elected...\n""There is NOTHING the left won\'t do to take down our President‚Äù, our country and us, no low they won\'t go to, to get their power back"", and sadly, we have seen this every single day since his election.\nLet me ask you this...Have you ever listened to Trump or appreciated any accomplishment or campaign promises he\'s kept, have you ever gone to one of his rallies or have you just closed your mind to ANYTHING he does?\nPlease ask yourselves the following questions, if you dare...\nWhat has Joe Biden done for America for the last 47 years that he\'s held an office?\nWhat did Joe Biden ever do for BLACKS when HE and Obama were in office?\nWhat has Joe Biden ever done in his entire life to create a private-sector job?\nWhat has Joe Biden done to help the American middle class worker?\nLet me also ask you this...\nWhy do you think there are so many people tearing down statues, our burning flag, beating up police officers, disrespecting our founders and hating our country?\nIt comes straight from our SCHOOLS that have slowly been tearing down our history...\nIf there is a teacher out there, please tell me the following:\nDo you teach the truth that it was the DEMOCRATS that:\nWere the KKK?\nThat the GRAND LEADER of the KKK was Robert Byrd, who was elected to congress and served for decades, and that it was Hillary, Bill, and Obama that gave his EULOGY praising him?\nThat the DEMOCRATS fought the Civil war to KEEP SLAVERY?\nThat the inner-city ghettoes were created by DEMOCRATS to keep control of slaves after they were freed?\nThat planned parenthood was founded in inner cities to CONTROL the BLACK POPULATION?\nIs any of this in your history books? Let me ask you this as well.\nCan a student speak up when he/she disagrees with a teacher when they say that Trump is a horrible president or the electoral college has to be eliminated? Don\'t think so?\nWell, I know a student that actually happened to...When the teacher said it had to be eliminated because Hillary lost, and he stated the reason it should stay,\nShe ripped him apart and gave the entire class a 5 hour test, and stated it was because he DARED to disagree with her...\nIs that happening in your schools?\nI\'m only asking questions....I\'d like your answers..\nPresident Trump and his entire family has been vilified, demeaned and disrespected, for one reason and one reason only.......HE WON...\nHave you noticed the DEMOCRATS only throw tantrums and OBJECT to everything he does and have NEVER ONCE gotten behind him to make America the best it can be?\nWHY? They can\'t afford to get behind him...he would WIN AGAIN, and they can\'t let that happen....if he wins again, the Democrat party will be destroyed and they know it...\nDid you notice that the ""CAGES"" the left claimed that Trump built to put Illegal children in, WERE BUILT BY OBAMA for the very purpose of PUTTING ILLEGAL CHILDREN IN?\nWas THAT all over the news when Obama did it? The very same ""CAGES""...but the media was silent!!\nHow about when Trump commuted Roger Stone\'s sentence,and was DEMONIZED 24/7 but NOT A WORD when Obama commuted 1715 inmates, which included 330 that he granted on his last day in office...\nDID WE EVEN HEAR one WORD about it? Were there reporters even reporting it...NO! Just look at the difference in the reporting. By the way, since Trump\'s been in office he\'s commuted 10 people...compare that to Obama...Is that reporting fair?\nHow about when Biden and Obama allowed the H1N1, the SWINE FLU, to INFECT MILLIONS of Americans before declaring it a health emergency....\nWas the press losing it\'s minds and calling it the OBAMAFLU AND BLAMING OBAMA and BIDEN for the spread ? SILENCE!\nCompare this to the NEGATIVE COVERAGE that Trump got when, he immediately halted travel from China when, in February, Nancy Pelosi went to Chinatown and said come on down, or when DeBlasio, in March, said ride the subways and go to broadway...BUT those same people are blaming Trump for the spread of coronavirus..\nA FINAL QUESTION:\nWhat have the DEMOCRATS done to help make America the best, to get behind a president that works tirelessly to care about WE THE PEOPLE instead of using us as political pawns..\nWhat have the democrats done for people of color EXCEPT for GIVING ILLEGALS more rights than citizens and having us pay for it...\nJUST imagine what this country could accomplish if the Democrats worked with him on the economy, the coronavirus, the inner cities where he\'s created opportunity zones, job training etc.\nWhen Trump tried to get school choice for inner-city students they ran Betsy Devoss out!! The dems running those innercity schools wanted no part of school choice.\nHave you ever wondered why it\'s cities that have been run, for decades, that have the MOST HOMELESS, the MOST CRIME, the most MURDERS, the worst INNER CITY schools, \nARE ALL RUN BY DEMOCRATS???\nIf you haven\'t started asking yourselves those questions, maybe you should..\nAs I said, my entire family used to be democrats, but NOT ONE will ever vote for a democrat again....\nThey asked themselves the same questions and the answer was clear.']",0

Local schools and their school boards are usually lacking in educational background and experience to govern schools, let alone having any scientific expertise to set up safe medically sound schools, protection of staff, and critically important transportation issues. Sununu has already dismissed two of the CDC recommendations. Just review the 13 hot spot states, and you will see, all but one, are run by republicans. Here is the bottom line, China 4400 plus deaths, America 153,000 plus. Lastly, Sununu follows and supports Betsy DeVos, who does not even have a college degree.
