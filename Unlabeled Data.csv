That\'s a marketing tool used to influence you.\nThe same industry that is shutting down free speech on social media and lining the pockets of politicians.\nParents will have to get creative since this is the industry that is purposely shutting down public schools in order to move children to this new model. This was all planned out PRE-Pandemic.\nSo when you read, look at how the kids are set up. In front of a computer. Read the article and look at how they are pushing towards online learning.\nThere is an agenda within this article from education next.\nPods can be a good alternative for parents who need them. So can home-schooling. But there is a difference when looking at solutions for parents and identifying the players who are looking to profit off of your kids by FORCING these shut-downs.\nYou can see it in this article.

I think that education is really the only way to get a wage increase and i agree that everyone who cant put themselves through school should be able to make enough to feed their families and have somewhat of a savings account. But there are so many factors and I think because new hampshire has so many small businesses that it is difficult for them to make a way for themselves so they have no choice but to keep labor costs low. I also think the higher the wages go, the less staff a small business will hire, which makes everything so much more stressful for those who already work there.']",2

I report to work tomorrow, remotely, with no clear path, and am uncertain of what, or who, I will be teaching in person in a few weeks. The districts framework, which the school board voted in favor of, has turned into a guideline. Our union is now working to remediate issues with the plan—including having up to 18 high school students in a small classroom. We cannot act or plan in a thoughtful way without leadership to guide us. That begins at the state level.\nAlso, I’ve been busy this summer trying to figure out childcare for my own two children since the governor refused to act in a way that allows the state to follow a uniform plan.

So nope, for now we need a transactional president: before we end up in one of the worst depressions this country has ever experienced.  ', ""Anthony Gelatt There is missing information.  Private schools do not receive federal assistance,  based on attendance.  Parents of the child have to 'foot the costs'.  The voucher program is newer, and helps to absorb some of the financial obligations,  but still most of the costs are on the parents, if they want their child in a private school.  However, all citizens end up paying taxes.  Some of those taxes go towards supporting the local schools.  As such, if you send your child to a private school, you still end up paying taxes as if he/she were attending a public school.  In effect, you end up paying both schools, if you send your child to private school.  But I digress,  the point is: general funding comes from the parents, paying tuition for their child to do to the private school, with a very small amount of help from state/federal governments.  And the teachers are not a part of a union, so their pay comes from the children's tuition payments, the same payments that go towards some of the operating costs of the school.  So no added state help means: no school opening,  loss of jobs (it is, in effect, a small business), and children routed back into public schools.  Then....trying to 'fit' the children into the current curriculum of the public school could be a cluster [f], as well.

In effect, they were actually stealing tax payers money, buy knowingly requesting more money than they were supposed to receive.  It's basically fraud."", 'Shelly Gingras  I know I have.  I went through our public school system, all my life.  Private schools do not have to adhere to stupid policies like ""no child left behind"".  At my school (not sure if this applies to all schools, at that time), if a student didn\'t qualify for honors math and honors English they were not accepted into the honors program - any of it.  Most ppl are stronger in one than the other.  So...it\'s stupid policies like that - that actually inhibit growth, that public schools can ignore, without retribution.  So yeah, before you get on that soap box, please know what you\'re talking about.  Oh...and Commom Core Math!  20 states have repealed it.  12 states are putting time and money into the repealing process.  Millions of dollars (your taxes) have gone into the development, implementation,  and running of this program.  There are three levels of common core standards, the most expensive being 8.3 billion dollars (how\'s that for some math?).  And that doesn\'t cover the costs/time put into cancelling the program.  In which,  a private school can easily side-step, with no penalties.  So there are some facts and figures.', 'Shelly Gingras  I believe you all are missing the money trail.  Private schools are small businesses.  Yes they may receive tax breaks (as do public schools), but they employ people, who also pay taxes, as well as spend within their communities. Also, it gives another educational option to our children. Let us not forget, the parents that are sending their children to these schools are paying taxes for public school,  and fees for their children to attend the private school.

In my district, families and teachers all had a choice to go in person or remote.  In the end, they had to recruit remote teachers because everyone wanted to be in person.  We are excited to be back.  However, we realize how teaching is not like a normal job.  You said you see as many people as I do.  Im put in a small room with 17 runny noses.  These kids have brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, all of whom are connected to other children in other buildings and schools districts.  The spiderweb effect at a school is different than most places.  And being in direct contact for longer periods of time.   Everybody knows kids need to be back in school.  We all know that, but we also know how great this risk is.  If you're not an educator or an administrator you are not qualified to make a decision on my job.  The number of experts that have come out critical over teachers is appalling.  Theyre not critical over doctors who are seeing patients remotely.

A rifle shooting uncommon ammo could strike a steel plate positioned just so that it threw hot metal fragments into exactly the right spot on dried materials and started a smouldering fire that no one noticed or dealt with.

We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.” — Trump in a speech in Michigan.\n\nFeb. 10: “Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.” — Trump at the White House.

As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.” — Trump at a White House briefing.\n\nFeb. 26: “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” — Trump at a press conference.\n\nFeb. 26: “I think every aspect of our society should be prepared.

It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” — Trump in a CNBC interview.\n\nJan. 30: “We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.” — Trump in a speech in Michigan.\n\nFeb. 10: “Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.” — Trump at the White House. (See our item “Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?“)\n\nFeb. 14: “There’s a theory that, in April, when it gets warm — historically, that has been able to kill the virus.  So we don’t know yet; we’re not sure yet. But that’s around the corner.” — Trump in speaking to National Border Patrol Council members.\n\nFeb. 23: “We have it very much under control in this country.” — Trump in speaking to reporters.\n\nFeb. 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” — Trump in a tweet.\n\nFeb. 26: “So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.” — Trump at a White House briefing.\n\nFeb. 26: “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” — Trump at a press conference.\n\nFeb. 26: “I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up.” — Trump at a press conference, when asked if “U.S. schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading.”\n\nFeb. 27: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” — Trump at a White House meeting with African American leaders.\n\nFeb. 29: “And I’ve gotten to know these professionals. They’re incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they’re very, very cool. They’ve done it, and they’ve done it well. Everything is really under control.” — Trump in a speech at the CPAC conference outside Washington, D.C.\n\nMarch 4: “[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40-plus people [from a cruise ship]. … We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers. But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States.” — Trump at a White House meeting with airline CEOs.\n\nMarch 4: “Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number.” — Trump in an interview on Fox News, referring to the percentage of diagnosed COVID-19 patients worldwide who had died, as reported by the World Health Organization. (See our item “Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate.”)\n\nMarch 7: “No, I’m not concerned at all. No, we’ve done a great job with it.” — Trump, when asked by reporters if he was concerned about the arrival of the coronavirus in the Washington, D.C., area. \n\nMarch 9: “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” — Trump in a tweet.\n\nMarch 10: “And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.” — Trump after meeting with Republican senators.\n\nA day later, on March 11, the WHO declared the global outbreak a pandemic.\n\nAugust 2020 Trump asked how to handles the fact that at this time and going up daily his adminstration has allowed 169k Americans to die of covid 19 Trump\'s answer ""It is what it is"".']",3

Taxpayers fund everything that happens in the state of New Hampshire and I absolutely expect more of my elected officials than simply serving as a roadblock. Sununu has been a non-entity for 3.5 years and I’m done with him.', 'Jared Parr You used a lot of words but barely answered the question I asked. Your assessment of Sununu’s effectiveness is that he has prevented legislation. So the best thing he has done is preventing others from doing something? His biggest accomplishment is being a roadblock to those trying to address issues or problems? How do you think a job interview would go if someone were asked to describe their biggest accomplishment and they talked about how they prevented other people from getting work done? Sununu is on a job interview. He’s asking me and every other New Hampshire voter to give him a job. The fact is that you making a life for yourself and me making a life for myself includes earning money, making smart investments, planning for the future, etc. I pay a significant amount of money to the state and I want them to treat my money like I do—I look for smart investments, I make decisions about improvements, I save for my retirement, I allocate money for education, etc. I expect my elected officials to spend my money similarly wisely in an effort to make our lives better—it’s our money after all. I haven’t seen that with Sununu. I haven’t seen highways being improved. I haven’t seen new employers being attracted to the state (the data showed stagnant job growth even before the pandemic). I haven’t seen smart and new investments in education. I’ve seen exactly what you said—Sununu has been a roadblock to more efficient and productive use of my tax dollars. I don’t need four more years of roadblocks and the same poor decisions with the spending of my tax dollars.', 'Kimberly Cunningham So what progress have you personally beheld under Sununu? I’m asking you personally—how has your life been made better by a direct action of Sununu? If it hasn’t, why not. Is it not OK to expect that your government would actually be working for you given that tax payers pay their paycheck?', 'Jared Parr Where did I say the government should take care of everything for me? I do expect my government officials to do something, however. Given the money they make and the taxes I pay, that’s a fair ask. Sununu has done nothing that has impacted my life for the better during his 3.5 years in office that wouldn’t have happened with anyone else occupying the position. He has been a non-entity. Try and come up with one way your life is better specifically better because of Sununu. Good luck.', 'Marc Gamache Here’s the problem—I could cite evidence that Sununu has vetoed bills to increase the minimum wage (leaving NH as the only New England state still at the federal minimum) while taking raises of $30k himself or I could cite his vetoes of bills designed to combat climate change. You’d simply say those are rhetoric or hyperbole even though there is ample evidence. Why? Because you likely don’t support changes like those. And therein lies the problem—you deny evidence as hyperbole when it contradicts your beliefs. Just because you don’t agree with something doesn’t make it rhetoric but that’s the sad state of affairs in Sununu’s NH and Trump’s America. You say he’s done a great job but ask yourself whether any evidence you could offer could not simply be considered hyperbole by people who oppose your view. Here’s what I can say: my life has gotten no better because of any action attributable to Sununu. He’s been a non-entity in my life and shouldn’t I be able to expect more of my governor than simply saying “he didn’t harm me”? What happened to the days when governors could be expected to move their states forward rather than simply maintaining status quo? So here’s my question for you—name one way where you personally have a better life because of something Sununu did that isn’t just a typical sound bite.', 'Karl McCormack I hope the Kool Aid was good--blocking you now.', ""Al Cataldo I read the executive order he issued. Did you? Feel free to cite the section where he indicates how Social Security would be funded (it's at the attached link--it won't take you long because he didn't offer any details). He doesn't have a plan to fund it. His one and only goal is to put more money back in the hands of big business by permanently eliminating the payroll tax (and this is the first step). Without the payroll tax, Social Security will be bankrupt within 3 years. I guess you don't care about the people who were hard working for their entire careers who are now relying on Social Security. Do yourself a favor and acquire a little knowledge instead of mindlessly drinking the Kool Aid. https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/"", 'Karl McCormack So how about those of us who have been paying into the socialist program that\'s been supporting you during retirement? I\'ve paid in max dollars for over 20 years. You\'re fine with Trump destroying the program and me getting nothing when I retire even though I\'ve contributed the 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare that you\'ve lived on? Awfully nice of you to say ""so be it"" after you\'ve lived off a socialist program I\'ve been funding for years. I\'ll take a socialist program over the selfish one you\'re advocating.', 'Karl McCormack You paid into a government administered program that used your money to pay benefits to the previous generation. Your money is gone—long gone. You’re living on money that current employees and their employers are contributing. If we stop contributing (as Trump has proposed by eliminating the “payroll tax”), the source of your funds are gone and you’ll get no social security benefits. So do you want this government administered socialist program or not?', 'Gloria Merrick Mottram Interesting that you seem to dislike socialism yet your profile shows you as retired. I guess you’re not receiving Social Security and paying for your own medical insurance? After all, they’re administered by the government and the funds are being paid for by people currently working. Your contributions are long gone—they funded the previous generation. It’d be great if people like you who don’t believe in these programs got off of them. If Trump has his way and removes the payroll tax, you won’t get Social Security at all as it will run out of funds by 2023. Hope you saved well!']",3

I know of one such good landlord that assessed her finances and decided not to raise rent on a single mother and her children who she knew was a hard working person trying to do the right things in life so that she could keep that tenant who was an excellent tenant. If she had raised the rent, the woman and her kids would have needed to find another apartment. The landlord did not want that. She was also living in the same building and was alone herself and felt safe with this woman and her children there as tenants. So what's wrong with that? I know another landlord who deducted a whole months rent from a tenants rent because they ran into a big emergency with their vehicle and the landlords gave them a break. Otherwise they would have had been evicted, the landlord would have lost what they considered to be their best tenant per their own words. These were private property owners.  Neither of these tenants ever abused that generosity. And these two landlords didn't charge crazy, out of control rents. \nAnd homeless people have ocean front views? So who says you can't be homeless and have an ocean point view in this country. The rich dont or shouldn't own ocean front views. The ocean is there or should be there for everyone to enjoy.

For those who want to get ahead, trying to avoid taking welfare is crucial, however, sometimes, people fall through the cracks, women and children. And yes, there are abuses of the system, but let's talk about those who want to get ahead, are doing everything right and still can't afford a roof over their head because of greedy landlords etc... whose rental prices are way too high etc.. maybe the government would not have to shell out so much money to subsidize rent for some people if some of these greedy landlords would be more realistic and not do greedy and have reasonable prices.

People go to the other extreme, sometimes, the opposite of what you speak about to try and correct the situation.

If you  don’t we ain’t bailing  you  out. ....I hear kids  crying that their  stressed  all  the  time  ...What stress? You want stress  trying raising  kids when  you  are  unemployed  in a down  economy ...many people do....try surviving  cancer  ...  or  my favorite is  that  scene in the  beginning of  “Saving  Private  Ryan“ where a  17 year  old boy was Shaking as he leaned  against the  landing boat door about  to hit  the beach knowing when  that door  dropped bullets  were going  to be flying  in killing  half the  people  in the  boat. Now thats  stress! No fed  program gonna  bail him out. You see  Debbie there  will  always be  more  people   who rather  not work  hard  rthen  willing to. Always be more  losers  then  winners,  More people scared  then  brave. Life will never  be  fair  people  are  born with different skills and  talents  heights  and weights. But if  you  place  those  in charge  that  pander to the  lost instead  of inspiring if  you reward need instead of  merit  you  will have  a country of unproductiveness  and  misery with  no one left  to recue.

It’s clearly socialist doctrine and I’m sure in the early 2000s some  Venezuelan professor  pushed this crap to a few corrupt politicians and started the decline of the best functioning economy in South America. It’s the charge and responsibility of each individual to secure his/her place in society. You can’t mandate drive and determination... that needs to be developed thru families and local communities.

The drama haunting 24/7 mainstream\nMedia blew this whole story out of proportion. I also disagree with the current stimulus packages supported by either side.  We went from a country that rationed and sacrificed  for over 4 years to fight a life threatening war2  and came out of that a stronger country. No one wants to wait 6 months today.

Skills work conditions availability of talent are all factors.  Socialist countries like Sweden don’t have  state minimum wage per se. the misuse of setting minimums began when Obama tried to sell burger wrapping jobs to boost his employment numbers. No one In their right mind would expect to raise a family of 4 wrapping burgers.

You grab a piece of fruit. But when government who produces nothing by itself... attempts to dictate wages and not allow the free market  to determine the value of labor that’s when you lose opportunity, you lose ambition and the country loses productivity.  Minimum wage jobs  should be for high school students or people looking for additional work. No one should be retiring as a burger wrapper after 40 years.  Somehow that person needs pressure to increase his skill set ', 'True wage is set by what someone is willing to pay. You want a higher wage ... go get the skills to qualify.

This  is  specifically  why the  pilgrims  left  Europe  where  that  was the  norm.   Unfortunately This  original  intent  has been morphed into  something  clearly  not  intended  by  the  Founders.     \n  I  appreciate  your  defense  of  public  schools.    I  come  from  a  family  of public  school  teachers ( mother,  grandparents, uncle,  niece  and  other  remote relatives.    I  was  also  educated  in a   public school.  But  after  my children  went  to  public school  for  several  years  my  wife  and  I  decided  to  homeschool  and  then  go  to private school  for  high  school  . You see,  public  school  is  not what  it  once  was.  Yes,  there are  a  few  good  ones  here  and there.   But and  large the education  has declined and  furthermore  the  values most  parents would like  their children to  learn  cannot  be  found  in  most  public  schools.  Furthermore the content has clearly  become  a  form of indoctrination.    This is why so  many  young  folks believe  that  socialism is a viable form of  government.   They  are  learning  this  in our  high schools and colleges.  Common Core is one the problems.  Lately  their is a move called the 1619 project - please  look  that up.  And I don’t blame the  teachers for most  of this.   School  administration officials need to act with  courage  and responsibility to our children  to protect them from this type of bad education.  But they seem either unwilling or unable.  That is specifically why so many of us are willing to pay more money to send our kids to private  school, even if some of the opportunities aren’t as good regarding different types of classes.  At  least good morals Are taught AND emphasized.  Please don’t try to  defend public schools on this account.  I have way  too much experience on this front as well as  does  anyone who  deals with both the public school vs private  school/homeschooled  products.  The truth is quite self evident.  And if you would like to see how separation of church and state began there  is a link  below.

Have  we  already  forgotten that before COVID  the  unemployment  rate  was  at  an  all time  low and  employers were having  difficulty  finding  workers?  wages  went  up,  free market worked.   Ask  Bernie  the  socialist Sanders  what  his  campaign  had  to  do  when he  had to  meet  a  minimum  wage  standard.  Didn’t  work  out  so  well  for  his  campaign  workers.

There are more examples but I hope you get my point. \nAs far as the president having a plan for a pandemic, that's not something that each president has a specific plan for. The government has protocols in place that are enacted automatically, regardless of who the president is at the time.

Every governer in the country, Cuomo included, said that the federal response to their requests was excellent.

Trump ignored the advice of health care professionals and the scientific community. In fact, he often derided their opinions and recommendations. Trump will not even be a role model for wearing a mask, which is the most effective way to prevent spread. Our country has become a laughingstock to the rest of the world because of our inability to control the pandemic. While the U.S. only accounts for 4% of the world population, we have suffered 20% of the COVID-19 cases.\n\nThere is no way to sugar coat it: Trump’s response to the pandemic has been a total failure.\n\nThe pandemic underscores the critical importance of adequate health insurance coverage. As a physician, seeing patients without health insurance is extremely troubling. Now, it is even more deadly. Uninsured patients often get delayed care or no care until they face a health crisis. As a result, these patients often present with advanced stages of diseases, compromising their treatment and recovery.\n\nWe were underprepared for this crisis in part because Trump spent the last four years trying to take insurance coverage away from millions of Americans. Through executive actions, Trump did everything he could to to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and create barriers to enrollment. As a result, the uninsured population grew by 1.4 million under his watch. His attempt to take away health insurance in the middle of a worldwide pandemic is unconscionable.\n\nJoe Biden, on the other hand, has a track record of expanding health care coverage for Americans. The Obama-Biden administration provided insurance to over 20 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act. The growth of access to health care has been life altering for millions of American families. It prevented insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, which affect more than 100 million people in the United States. As a doctor, I have seen this expansion of coverage insurance make the difference between life and death.\n\nIt is obvious that Americans need reliable health insurance now more than ever. Joe Biden has extensive plans for improving our health care system and insurance coverage. He will begin by protecting and growing the Affordable Care Act. He will also add a public option similar to Medicare. Joe Biden has laid out a detailed set of plans that would ensure every American could get coverage quickly:\n\nFor those who have lost jobs, the Biden plan would have the federal government cover\n\n100% of COBRA cost so you can keep your same plan.\n\nFor those who are uninsured, the Biden plan would reopen enrollment for the Affordable Care Act now.\n\nFor those on Medicaid, the Biden plan would boost federal support during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nFor those between 60-65, the Biden plan would allow early enrollment in Medicare as another choice.\n\nThe Biden plan would make COVID testing and any vaccine free.\n\nThe Biden plan would ensure that ACA premiums will be limited to 8.5% of income.\n\nThe Biden plan would rein in ever expanding pharmaceutical costs.\n\nFor the sake of our communities’ health, I sincerely hope we elect Joe Biden. We are a swing state where every vote counts. Please be sure you are registered, and make a plan to vote in person or by mail. Granite Staters’ lives are on the line this November, and your vote could make the difference.\n']",3

The voucher rarely pays the whole tuition, poor people can rarely afford the tuition balance so money is taken out of the system that is charged with the education of these students.  So in the end vouchers are a detriment to the poor.', 'The public money is in fact for the public option.  So you are wrong.', 'Keith MacMaster I still believe that the money needs to be used to improve the system that is available to all not bolster the charter schools who discriminate.  Nothing you can say will ever change my mind on that.  Public money needs to stay in the public system that provides an education for all and are prohibited from any form of discrimination.  My property taxes need to go to bolster the system that is available to all!', 'Keith MacMaster I think the voucher system takes money from the only system that is available to many students, vouchers do not cover the whole tuition thus excluding children whose parents cannot pay the balance.  They typically do not take special needs students so those children are left in a system that vouchers have taken away its resources to provide an education.  If those schools accepted all students regardless of the parents ability to pay, will remember that tax money should not be used to support a religious institution( separation of church and state), and that special needs students of all levels should be accepted if that is where their parents want them to go.  You continue to raise, parent,and educate your children according to your values at home.  Home is the correct place for values and principles to be taught.  It is my belief that sending your children to school to learn what is your responsibility to teach them is really shirking your responsibility.', 'Keith MacMaster you have an option you can send your children where ever you want. The public option is without tuition and there are options you can choose at your own expense.  No one is taking that choice away from you.', 'Keith MacMaster in my opinion they are not.  Employees need unions to look out for them!  Teachers are employees not indentured servants and they need their unions to make sure they are not taken advantage of.  They are professionals and deserve to be able to do the job they were educated to do.', 'Keith MacMaster not calling you a thief and your anti union rhetoric is absurd.  You do have a right to give your children whatever education you want but I don’t have to pay for it.', 'Keith MacMaster I disagree with you and if you think this is so you should be working to improve the system and not stealing funds from the public option.  Private and charter schools don’t have to take special needs children.  They don’t have to take anyone they don’t want to take.  Public money should not be taken to fund these exclusionary options.  When they will take every child who wants to go there without exception then they can have public funds.', 'Keith MacMaster And religious based schools produce bigots and adults that don’t know how to be citizens of a diverse society.  I still think that public money should be used to improve the public option.  If you choose to send your children to private school then you need to pay for it.  The money comes from the taxes I pay and I am not interested in financing a narrow education.  My four year old granddaughter can make change and so what if they need to use a calculator.', 'Keith MacMaster I don’t know where you live but in NH the schools are mostly funded by local property taxes.  The schools are controlled by local school boards.  That is local control.  Private and charter schools escape that control so the should also be excluded from local public funds.', 'Keith MacMaster I disagree with your opinion, and I strongly believe that public money be spent on public endeavors.  If private schools would take all children tuition free then I might consider that public funds could be used.  But as long as those schools discriminate by ability to pay, I don’t think they have a right to public money.  For example, there is a Catholic school in my community.  I am Catholic and wanted my children to get a Catholic education.  I wasn’t in the position to pay the tuition so my kids went to public school.  My children did not get a political education in school they got that from their very liberal parents.  There was no brainwashing being done.  No one was rewriting history.  My children benefited from attending school with a diverse student body.  They learned there was no absolute right way.  They were in class with children that looked different and had different beliefs.  I am afraid that in our Community Catholic school it would never have happened.  Now 27 years later I see the value of a nonrestricted public education.  You can involve yourself in school improvement for all schools which would be more productive then posting on Facebook.', 'Keith MacMaster children should learn their ethics at home.  If you want your children taught that in school then you have the freedom to pay for it.  If private schools take public money than they need to use the curricula the public money pays for.  I don’t want my tax money paying for your children ethical education.  And I bet the majority of tax payers feel that way and in a democracy majority rules.']",3

Historically the United states has never been a Christian nation because our country has no official religion.\nSo.... stop being racist. Stop being a history revisionist, OR look up the actual history. Don\'t cherry pick which founding documents you subscribe to if you are loyal to them you have to be loyal to ALL of them.

Most of the conservatives here in NH that I\'ve spoken to are downright against any public safety shutdowns, the wearing of masks to help prevent the spread of a deadly virus that kills elderly and the immunocompromised. Should you say that you are immunocompromised due to illnesses like asthma you get told that it\'s your fault, and you should stay home (because people who get sick easily shouldnt be allowed to buy groceries, or live basically). Theyll gather in the state capital to protest wearing masks because they\'re uncomfortable and then harshly criticize those who gather to protest while wearing masks for the inequal treatment of black people in this country. They also staunchly deny climate change which is killing our planet and effectively making it unlivable for our future generations. They say they support job creators and small businesses and then do all their shopping at walmart.\nSo, I\'m done listening to conservatives brandish the state motto like a weapon and using it to argue for less regulation. The motto was inspired by the residents not willing to bow down to those whose interests would hinder our local populace, and, quite frankly, the conservatives are the ones whose interests are effectively hindering our state now.']",3

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that of the first 68,998 U.S. deaths from COVID-19, only 12 have been in children under age 14 — less than 0.02 percent. Nor is coronavirus killing teenagers. At last count, the fatality total among children under 18 without an underlying condition is one; only ten of the 16,469 confirmed coronavirus deaths in New York City were among those under the age of 18. That’s similar to the fatality rate for those under 20 in France, estimated at 0.001 percent, and in Spain.\n\nThe death of even one child is tragic, of course. Yet, it must be kept in mind that as many as 600 children in the United States died from seasonal influenza in 2017-18, according to CDC estimates, while the CDC’s estimate for COVID-19 fatalities number just 12. A just-released JAMA Pediatrics study flatly states: “Our data indicate that children are at far greater risk of critical illness from influenza than from COVID-19.” If the COVID-19 hazard sets the new standard for health safety, the country will need to close its schools each year from November until April to guard against influenza.\n\nWhat about the new threat similar to Kawasaki disease, recently sensationalized as a COVID-19 association? In fact, the association is extremely low, and the incidence of the disorder is itself rare, affecting only 3,000 to 5,000 children in the United States each year. Importantly, the syndrome is typically treatable and never has been regarded previously as a risk so serious that schools must be shuttered.\n\nWhile public attention is focused on exceptional rarities, learning is in free-fall. In Boston, only half of students are showing up for online instruction on any given day; 20 percent of them have never logged on to the designated website. ""This situation is going to be like what is often called the summer slide [in student achievement], but on steroids,"" says Virginia\'s state school superintendent. \n\nLow-income students are suffering the most. Many lack WIFI, computer tablets, software and other paraphernalia of the affluent. Nor are they as likely to have access to equivalent mentors at home as those with better educated parents. Robin Lake at the Center for Reinventing Public Education says that “elementary students [in urban districts] may have lost 30 percent of their reading skills.”\n\nClosure will endanger the health of our children, too. Already, more than half of America’s children are not receiving needed vaccinations. Further, schools are the place where many learn that they need glasses or a hearing aid, or, if seriously ill, are guided by the school nurse to the doctor’s office for prompt medical attention.\n\nIn addition, children are being denied opportunities for social and emotional development that come with play, exercise, sports and socialization. Reports already indicate that suicide rates among the young are on the increase. More certain is the loss in human capital that lasts a lifetime: Closing schools this past spring translates into a 3 percent or more cut in lifetime earnings for those whose education is being sidelined. Clearly, closing schools does not benefit those whom schools are supposed to serve. \n\nBut what about the adults — the teachers, guidance counsellors, bus drivers and kitchen staff? No one wants to endanger the health of educators but, fortunately, risks to adults in schools are much less than those encountered in grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential businesses. As is shown across the world, including Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Iceland, the UK, Australia and now Ireland, children seldom if ever transmit the disease to adults, even to their parents. Several epidemiologists recently denounced the widely cited April publication that erroneously concluded that children can transmit COVID-19 just as readily as adults. Its author, German virologist Christian Drosten, previously had been featured as a COVID-19 hero, abetting the panic to close schools.\n\nNo less important, COVID-19 mainly targets the elderly and those with underlying conditions. For people under 60, COVID-19 fatality rates are so low that they are less than or equal to those associated with the seasonal flu, according to data from France, Spain and the Netherlands, as well as the CDC. Certainly, adults at high risk or who are fearful should take precautions, and by now they understand how to social-distance for their own protection. But teaching is a young person’s occupation. Teachers’ median age is 41; more than 80 percent are under the age of 55, the age at which most become eligible for a retirement pension.  \n\nIf opening day should come sooner, how should schools open? \n\nUnfortunately, it is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom that students should be asked to attend half-days, wear masks, skip recess, spread themselves six feet apart and spend half their time in front of a computer — all in the name of social distancing. But how can classrooms hold students spread apart by six feet? How can you practice phonics with your mouth covered? How can you learn if it is time to return home just as you have settled into your seat? How can you develop socially and emotionally if you must remain distant from friends at recess? How can teachers instruct with masks on their faces? \n\nAll of this borders on the absurd, when we now know that social distancing and face coverings for children are completely unnecessary. \n\nNever have schools subjected children to such an unhealthy, uncomfortable and anti-educational environment, so science cannot precisely define the total harm it will cause. But science does tell us that risks from COVID-19 are too minimal to sacrifice the educational, social, emotional and physical well-being – to say nothing of the very health – of our young people.   \n\nScott W.

We homeschooled all 3 of our children, two of them K - 12 and one of them 3-12. I did not head out daily to gainful employment and we paid for all of our books on which we also paid sales tax. We live in a community that only recently built an elementary school. The town buses students to other communities to educate them. Each household pays over $6,000 annually for this privilege. So we educated our own , paid taxes on the materials we used, and we pay to educate others . We never asked for any $ from the government. After educating my own children I see major issues that need addressing. I do not claim to be an expert but I am an involved parent and a taxpayer watching public funds being used irresponsibly. My kids were and are successful students. My oldest has a BS and is now a taxpayer, my younger two are working on their degrees. All 3 scored very high on standardized tests. And, we pay out of pocket for their college. There needs to be changes.  Don’t tell me to pay for it myself. My family has and continues to pay.', 'Brian Nelson well this has come full circle, back where we began. Sorry, Brian, I disagree. It’s ok to disagree. They are my tax dollars too so my opinion should be heard. I think way back when, a long time ago, the question was, how do we educate our youth. The mission is the same but maybe the answer needs to be adjusted. Public schools, or what I like to call government schools have been the go to. It’s really no longer working for a lot of youth or for much of our society. Focus on the youth and at least “see” the other point of view. I know a lot of people cling to the status quo.', 'Brian Nelson So you are saying that taxpayers pay taxes for the purpose of standing up schools and paying teachers and other staff and not for the purpose of educating our youth?

No one is holding a gun to anyone\'s head forcing them to take them. As such, your claims about business ""running roughshod"" is nothing more than promoting a victim mentality.\n\nYou are, as can be expected, wrong on the facts of what I am advocating. And unlike what you and the left advocate, there is proof that what I advocate works, right in front of us in fact. Prior to the pandemic, most of the biggest rises in wages were seen by the ""little guys"", contrary to popular liberal belief. For example, wages have soared since Trump took office, with median household income up over $5,000, compared to barely $1,000 over Obama\'s 8 years and less than half that under George W. Bush (a big government Republican, hardly a conservative).\n\nI\'ll leave you with this, and a summary of what it says that shows the left\'s rank dishonesty and aversion to facts:  https://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.aspx\n\n- When it comes to race, wage growth for whites was a tick behind, at 3.5 percent, while non-whites charged ahead at 4.3 percent.\n- In terms of age, the young and the restless rule. Those ages 16 to 24 saw wages climb 8.4 percent. Americans 25 to 54 enjoyed 3.9 percent higher paychecks. And the typically higher-income 55-plus crowd was behind the curve, with 2.5 percent wage growth.\n- Bachelor’s degrees generated 3.7 percent wage boosts for those who held them. But those who went no further than high-school graduation also savored 3.7 percent higher pay. Those with associate degrees saw their checks grow just 3.2 percent.\n- While those in finance and business services scored 4.1 percent higher salaries, workers in manufacturing, construction, and mining were in a photo finish with them at 4.0 percent.\n- While job stayers earned 3.2 percent more money, job switchers scored an extra 4.3 percent.\n- Interestingly enough, those with low, medium, and high skills all shared 3.6 percent wage increases, matching the nationwide bonus.', 'Laurel Dean Why would you want to live somewhere that you can only complain about? You may have a right to live here, but what kind of life is it to be outraged all the time when you have it so well?

As the chart below shows, multiple jobholding has been associated with periods of both high and low unemployment. Over the period for which BLS collects data, multiple jobholding peaked between 1995 and 1996 (6.2 percent of the population), at which point the official unemployment rate (U-3) averaged 5.5 percent. Over the course of the Great Recession, 5.2 percent of the population held multiple jobs, during which the official unemployment rate jumped to 9.3 percent. Since then, the multiple jobholding rate has continually declined. As of 2017, it was 4.9 percent.  Trends also appear uncorrelated with the U-6 rate, which captures involuntary part-time workers (workers who work part-time, but do so for economic reasons and would rather work full-time). Irrespective of the unemployment rate, the long-run multiple jobholding rate is declining.""\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/aparnamathur/2019/08/04/are-most-people-actually-working-two-or-three-jobs-not-really/#32edf7024a56', ""Jeff Rich If you want minimum wage to be something people can live on, then you should advocate lower taxes and reducing the size, scope and power of the government.

By leaving it up to local control and each district, he created a huge problem for teachers with children and their ability to return to work.  A large part of the teaching force in a school does not live in the same district they teach in.  There is no rhyme or reason to one district being remote and the district in the town over being hybrid or face to face and many districts like Portsmouth and Exeter who have changed their plans have probably done so because of the staffing issues that have been caused by leaving it up to each district.  If he truly wanted to lead and provide our state with ""flexibility"" he should have provided a clear structure for when each learning platform should be used and provided directions by counties or geographical regions so that this mess that we are dealing with would not be happening.']",2
