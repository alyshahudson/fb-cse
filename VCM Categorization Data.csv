23,every trade has a shortage of workers because kids were told to go to college noone told their kids you can make just as much or more in a trade traditional american values are being lost and just so your aware almost all ethnic roofing crews drive up from boston you cannot compete with their prices but they do not have pride in their work either they nail high and have shiners all over the place i would double check your roof you should not see a single nail robin schnell you are correct  i agree with you 100 i am a framing contractor and i have tried everything to find workers i also pay above average for the industry im in my point was that making minimum wage a law makes certain businesses close down or not worth running if someone cant find work because they do not produce why shouldnt they make less work is a huge life choice we should be teaching children to do research about jobs and find a job that will support a family its not as easy as just raising the minimum wage i feel that does more harm then good there is a lot to it but thats what capitalism is supposed to be about companies should have competitive wages people should not stay at a job they are miserable at life got misconstrued somewhere down the line raising the minimum wage only destroys business and makes sure less skilled people will be replaced by automation why cant people find a better paying job you want to force businesss to pay a certain amount when it should be a mutual thing  if a person is not worth the minimum wage and it sucks to say that but its true then that person is unhirable whereas if they could work for what they are worth and would be hired by someone  we should be advocating for people to quit jobs they are not happy with instead of running business into the ground raising the minimum wage only destroys business and makes sure less skilled people will be replaced by automation why cant people find a better paying job you want to force businesss to pay a certain amount when it should be a mutual thing  if a person is not worth the minimum wage and it sucks to say that but its true then that person is unhirable whereas if they could work for what they are worth and would be hired by someone  we should be advocating for people to quit jobs they are not happy with instead of running business into the ground,2,5.5,1.0,84.62,0.0

131,robin schnell i work on 1150hour i can pay my bills 750 rent 225 car payment 100 cell phone 25 credit card every month but a savings account isnt an option ive been trying to save as much as i can but if the minimum wage was raised i would most likely get a raise as well i remember when i was 1516 my pay was always 725 at 17 i was at 10 an hour at one job 850 at the other summer job at 18 i was being paid 905 at 19 12 an hour at 20 10 an hour plus 100 a week minimum in tips all of those were food service jobs i just moved onto retail and make 1150 but it is the best job i have had to date id say my only question is why is it that i can go from job to job with even more experience but still get lowballed for a wage ive been in the hospitality industry since i was 15 and it seemed like the extra experience i had never really gave me much of a pay bump except for my first job they were all abovenminimum wage im not really sure what my point is just trying to illustrate my struggles with being paid what is a fair wage  i am a college student by the way and have to pay for my education on my own i have some student loan refunds that really help me each semester but it is rarely more than 500 i think that education is really the only way to get a wage increase and i agree that everyone who cant put themselves through school should be able to make enough to feed their families and have somewhat of a savings account but there are so many factors and i think because new hampshire has so many small businesses that it is difficult for them to make a way for themselves so they have no choice but to keep labor costs low i also think the higher the wages go the less staff a small business will hire which makes everything so much more stressful for those who already work there,2,6.9143,0.0,100.0,0.0

189,leslie irving un fortunately the minimum wage was not created for that its original intent was to try to close the income gapand to have a starting wage for new workers it never closed the income gap due to the reasons i first stated when i first responded to your post the minimun wage was never intended to support a family at the time many young people were entering workforce as unpaid apprentices until they learned their craft this helped slightly to at least get some money into their pockets  thank you for the links i will watch read later but you still havent answered my question what do you personally think the fair minimum wage should be a maximum wage should never be set what an employer is willing to pay for the skills and experience to do any job is between the employer and the prospective employee leslie irving so then heres my question what do you think the living wage should be set at leslie irving not that at all us has a generous social safety netbut its designed for people to use it and then get back to work not to stay on the govt dole we as a nation unfortunately have become a  ask the govt for help first rather than utilizing our god given gifts to find our own ways of getting ahead every time we ask the govt to do something for us it always is more expensiveless efficient and usually not done as well as it is done in the private sector or at minimumat the much more local level by saying we have to have a living wage mandated by the govtyou are saying that you cant do it on your own thats says more about you than it does about any groupwhether its conservativeliberallibertarianprogressive what have you  leslie irving and knowing thisit is then our responsibility as individuals to then make arrangements and any changes neccessary to cover any potential shortfalls not the business owners you do whats needed to accomodate your needs he does whats needed to stay profitable in order to accomodate his needs  cathy teran if you suddenly raise the wages of everone newly hired by 5 bucks then every one currently working will be demanding a 5 per hr raise as well businesses will have to do one of three things 1 raise prices on all there inventorymost likelyvto a point where customers wont buy them because theyre not worth the price 2 owner will have to lay off workers because he cant afford themor cut hours to keep payroll down 3 owner will not hire any new workers because he needs to keep payroll down  all three points hurt business it is not the responsibility of the business owner to make sure any employee has enough income to make ends meet its his responsibility to make sure his business makes a profit so that he makes enough money to make his own ends meet  thats why people create their own businesses the amount of money that an employee makes should be that which the owner and employee agree upon up front if you as an employee dont like the termsdont take the job the govt shouldnt be getting involved with mandating what owners should be paying palmer autumnbee watson i agreebut i also believe we should move to a voucher type system we should have the choice to where we send our kids  palmer autumnbee watson so then are you saying that the tax dollars that those who send their kids to private schools should get their money back considering that they are actually paying twice  there are private schools that have public kids enrolled theredue to some towns not having a highschool some are regional schools  if no public school taxes to private schoolsthen those families who go to private schools get an abatement fair is fair there is nothing stopping companies from paying more than minimum wage no one has the right to any wage no matter how big or small its a negotiation between employer and prospective employee the employer spends more money paying for peoples greater skills if all you are doing is something that requires on the most basic of skills you are going to get paid much less than some one who has much more complex skills it is not the responsibility of any company to guarantee that any employees has the funds needed to cover all their needs its primary responsibilty is to make a profit and stay in business to acheive the goals that the founder or owner of the business wishes to achieve,3,2.55,8.5,76.92,1.0

326,christina murphy  what we need is a coherent president  the current president saved this country hundreds of millions of dollars in bad trade agreements  so nope for now we need a transactional president before we end up in one of the worst depressions this country has ever experienced   anthony gelatt there is missing information  private schools do not receive federal assistance  based on attendance  parents of the child have to foot the costs  the voucher program is newer and helps to absorb some of the ficial obligations  but still most of the costs are on the parents if they want their child in a private school  however all citizens end up paying taxes  some of those taxes go towards supporting the local schools  as such if you send your child to a private school you still end up paying taxes as if heshe were attending a public school  in effect you end up paying both schools if you send your child to private school  but i digress  the point is general funding comes from the parents paying tuition for their child to do to the private school with a very small amount of help from statefederal governments  and the teachers are not a part of a union so their pay comes from the childrens tuition payments the same payments that go towards some of the operating costs of the school  so no added state help means no school opening  loss of jobs it is in effect a small business and children routed back into public schools  thentrying to fit the children into the current curriculum of the public school could be a cluster f as well  in short allowing private schools to flounder is just plain bad business  and not fair those the children steve macdow oneil wrong on this account  please  read my explanations above elizabeth callahan oneil wrong on this account  please  read my explanations above priscilla hardy oneil wrong on this account  please  read my explanations above richard oneil wrong on this account  please  read my explanations above christina murphy  i said nothing about class size  i also was not challenged enough  public schools boost their admissions too  months after i quit they had kept me on their student lists  they actually got in trouble because they were receiving federalstatelocal funding based on enrollment numbers but were incorrectly reporting attendance on many students  in effect they were actually stealing tax payers money buy knowingly requesting more money than they were supposed to receive  its basically fraud shelly gingras  i know i have  i went through our public school system all my life  private schools do not have to adhere to stupid policies like no child left behind  at my school not sure if this applies to all schools at that time if a student didnt qualify for honors math and honors english they were not accepted into the honors program  any of it  most ppl are stronger in one than the other  soits stupid policies like that  that actually inhibit growth that public schools can ignore without retribution  so yeah before you get on that soap box please know what youre talking about  ohand commom core math  20 states have repealed it  12 states are putting time and money into the repealing process  millions of dollars your taxes have gone into the development implementation  and running of this program  there are three levels of common core standards the most expensive being 83 billion dollars hows that for some math  and that doesnt cover the coststime put into cancelling the program  in which  a private school can easily sidestep with no penalties  so there are some facts and figures shelly gingras  i believe you all are missing the money trail  private schools are small businesses  yes they may receive tax breaks as do public schools but they employ people who also pay taxes as well as spend within their communities also it gives another educational option to our children let us not forget the parents that are sending their children to these schools are paying taxes for public school  and fees for their children to attend the private school  so in times like these helping a second educational option stay alive seems to make the most sense,3,2.4591000000000003,1.0,71.09,

625,bernadette halloran the steel core ammo they refer to is only commonly available in two rifle calibers and is already prohibited at all regular guns ranges that i know of copper bullets are also fairly uncommon and generally used in certain high powered hunting applications all of which is to say that apparently this could happen a rifle shooting uncommon ammo could strike a steel plate positioned just so that it threw hot metal fragments into exactly the right spot on dried materials and started a smouldering fire that no one noticed or dealt with the odds are just very much against it which is why there is no actual proof that this happens on any sort of a regular basis in the real world  selma alabbas thats about very specific types of ammo shot under very specific circumstances the article itself states lead core copper jacket bullets appear to have a low probability of starting fires this would describe most ammo commonly being shot the article does state that many fires are caused by target shooting but provides zero documentation or specifics in support of that claim so in the end it is apparently possible but you still have no actual evidence that this does happen on any sort of basis to make it statistically relevant back yard gun ranges pose no fire threat with or without permitting and inspection,3,1.0,0.0,100.0,0.0

closely with china and other countries and we think its going to have a very good ending for us  that i can assure you  trump in a speech in michigannnfeb 10 now the virus that were talking about having to do  you know a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat  as the heat comes in typically that will go away in april were in great shape though we have 12 cases  11 cases and

in a speech at the cpac conference outside washington dcnnmarch 4 we have a very small number of people in this country infected we have a big country the biggest impact we had was when we took the 40plus people from a cruise ship  we brought them back we immediately quarantined them but you add that to the numbers but if you dont add that to the numbers were talking about very small numbers in the united states  trump at a white house meeting with airline ceosnnmarch 4 well i think the 34 is really a false number  trump in an interview on fox news referring to the percentage of diagnosed covid19 patients worldwide who had died as reported by the world health organization see our item trump and the coronavirus death ratennmarch 7 no im not concerned at all no weve done a great job with it  trump when asked by reporters if he was concerned about the arrival of the coronavirus in the washington dc area nnmarch 9 so last year 37000 americans died from the common flu it averages between 27000 and 70000 per year nothing is shut down life  the economy go on at this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 22 deaths think about that  trump in a tweetnnmarch 10 and were prepared and were doing a great job with it and it will go away just stay calm it will go away  trump after meeting with republican senatorsnna day later on march 11 the who declared the global outbreak a pandemicnnaugust 2020 trump asked how to handles the fact that at this time and going up daily his adminstration has allowed 169k americans to die of covid 19 trumps answer it is what it is  shawn mitchell trump forced other countries in since before january to release americans by the thousands into the usa that were in quarantine calling it a democrat hoax trump is a colossal fuck up of epic proportions we have more dead 190k and more infected 9 million than all of the world the only thing trump has lead us to is more deaths than anywhere on the entire world due to his responses

control we have very little problem in this country at this moment  five  and those people are all recuperating successfully but were working very closely with china and other countries and we think its going to have a very good ending for us  that i can assure you  trump in a speech in michigannnfeb 10 now the virus that were talking about having to do  you know a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat  as the heat comes in typically that will go away in april were in great shape though we have 12 cases  11 cases and many of them are in good shape now  trump at the white house see our item will the new coronavirus go away in aprilnnfeb 14 theres a theory that in april when it gets warm  historically that has been able to kill the virus  so we dont know yet were not sure yet but thats around the corner  trump in speaking to national border patrol council membersnnfeb 23 we have it very much under control in this country  trump in speaking to reportersnnfeb 24 the coronavirus is very much under control in the usa we are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries cdc  world health have been working hard and very smart stock market starting to look very good to me  trump in a tweetnnfeb 26 so were at the low level as they get better we take them off the list so that were going to be pretty soon at only five people and we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time so weve had very good luck  trump at a white house briefingnnfeb 26 and again when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero thats a pretty good job weve done  trump at a press conferencennfeb 26 i think every aspect of our society should be prepared i dont think its going to come to that especially with

everything is under control i mean theyre very very cool theyve done it and theyve done it well everything is really under control  trump in a speech at the cpac conference outside washington dcnnmarch 4 we have a very small number of people in this country infected we have a big country the biggest impact we had was when we took the 40plus people from a cruise ship  we brought them back we immediately quarantined them but you add that to the numbers but if you dont add that to the numbers were talking about very small numbers in the united states  trump at a white house meeting with airline ceosnnmarch 4 well i think the 34 is really a false number  trump in an interview on fox news referring to the percentage of diagnosed covid19 patients worldwide who had died as reported by the world health organization see our item trump and the coronavirus death ratennmarch 7 no im not concerned at all no weve done a great job with it  trump when asked by reporters if he was concerned

1961 increased social security benefits and the minimum wagehe did all that in less time in office than sununu has had when sununus track record equals kennedys ill consider voting for him until then im going to ask what hes doing with my tax dollars and why his supporters can only cite his vetoes as his biggest accomplishment sununu remains a nonentity who doesnt deserve four more years in office wasting tax payer dollars kimberly cunningham i dont need connecticuti need my tax dollars to be spent more intelligently and economically in new hampshire i need a governor who can say more than i vetoed that legislation sununu has had 35 years to get something done and he hasnt someone else needs a chance because clearly sununu is not capable of action randy grasso how did that help me what if that tax was going to be used to pave the road where i live what if it was going to be used to provide a better education for my children vetoing an income tax that would have funded things i cant do for myself ie i cant pave the road where i live does not help me there is a function of government and sununu has failed miserably with delivering any progress jared parr gooders like me who want things like roads schools and drinking water how dare i demand those sort of things im going to explain how our state government is funded and then im done with you because its clear that you havent spent even a few minutes trying to develop a coherent understanding of your own state government 30 of our state expenditures are covered by federal funds and where do those federal funds come from thats righttaxes and thats in addition to the property taxes highway fees meals taxes etc that are pay taxpayers fund everything that happens in the state of new hampshire and i absolutely expect more of my elected officials than simply serving as a roadblock sununu has been a nonentity for 35 years and im done with him jared parr you used a lot of words but barely answered the question i asked your assessment of sununus effectiveness is that he has prevented legislation so the best thing he has done is preventing others from doing something his biggest accomplishment is being a roadblock to those trying to address issues or problems how do you think a job interview would go if someone were asked to describe their biggest accomplishment and they talked about how they prevented other people from getting work done sununu is on a job interview hes asking me and every other new hampshire voter to give him a job the fact is that you making a life for yourself and me making a life for myself includes earning money making smart investments planning for the future etc i pay a significant amount of money to the state and i want them to treat my money like i doi look for smart investments i make decisions about improvements i save for my retirement i allocate money for education etc i expect my elected officials to spend my money similarly wisely in an effort to make our lives betterits our money after all i havent seen that with sununu i havent seen highways being improved i havent seen new employers being attracted to the state the data showed stagt job growth even before the pandemic i havent seen smart and new investments in education ive seen exactly what you saidsununu has been a roadblock to more efficient and productive use of my tax dollars i dont need four more years of roadblocks and the same poor decisions with the spending of my tax dollars kimberly cunningham so what progress have you personally beheld under sununu im asking you personallyhow has your life been made better by a direct action of sununu if it hasnt why not is it not ok to expect that your government would actually be working for you given that tax payers pay their paycheck jared parr where did i say the government should take care of everything for me i do expect my government officials to do something however given the money they make and the taxes i pay thats a fair ask sununu has done nothing that has impacted my life for the better during his 35 years in office that wouldnt have happened with anyone else occupying the position he has been a nonentity try and come up with one way your life is better specifically better because of sununu good luck marc gamache heres the problemi could cite evidence that sununu has vetoed bills to increase the minimum wage leaving nh as the only new england state still at the federal minimum while taking raises of 30k himself or i could cite his vetoes of bills designed to combat climate change youd simply say those are rhetoric or hyperbole even though there is ample evidence why because you likely dont support changes like those and therein lies the problemyou deny evidence as hyperbole when it contradicts your beliefs just because you dont agree with something doesnt make it rhetoric but thats the sad state of affairs in sununus nh and trumps america you say hes done a great job but ask yourself whether any evidence you could offer could not simply be considered hyperbole by people who oppose your view heres what i can say my life has gotten no better because of any action attributable to sununu hes been a nonentity in my life and shouldnt i be able to expect more of my governor than simply saying he didnt harm me what happened to the days when governors could be expected to move their states forward rather than simply maintaining status quo so heres my question for youname one way where you personally have a better life because of something sununu did that isnt just a typical sound bite karl mccormack i hope the kool aid was goodblocking you now al cataldo i read the executive order he issued did you feel free to cite the section where he indicates how social security would be funded its at the attached linkit wont take you long because he didnt offer any details he doesnt have a plan to fund it his one and only goal is to put more money back in the hands of big business by permanently eliminating the payroll tax and this is the first step without the payroll tax social security will be bankrupt within 3 years i guess you dont care about the people who were hard working for their entire careers who are now relying on social security do yourself a favor and acquire a little knowledge instead of mindlessly drinking the kool aid httpswwwwhitehousegovpresidentialactionsmemorandumdeferringpayrolltaxobligationslightongoingcovid19disaster karl mccormack so how about those of us who have been paying into the socialist program thats been supporting you during retirement ive paid in max dollars for over 20 years youre fine with trump destroying the program and me getting nothing when i retire even though ive contributed the 62 for social security and 145 for medicare that youve lived on awfully nice of you to say so be it after youve lived off a socialist program ive been funding for years ill take a socialist program over the selfish one youre advocating karl mccormack you paid into a government administered program that used your money to pay benefits to the previous generation your money is gonelong gone youre living on money that current employees and their employers are contributing if we stop contributing as trump has proposed by eliminating the payroll tax the source of your funds are gone and youll get no social security benefits so do you want this government administered socialist program or not gloria merrick mottram interesting that you seem to dislike socialism yet your profile shows you as retired i guess youre not receiving social security and paying for your own medical insurance after all theyre administered by the government and the funds are being paid for by people currently working your contributions are long gonethey funded the previous generation itd be great if people like you who dont believe in these programs got off of them if trump has his way and removes the payroll tax you wont get social security at all as it will run out of funds by 2023 hope you saved well,3,14.816600000000001,3.7143,79.96,0.0

not understanding whats being talked about here you just keep going back to those who arent trying that was never the point here and yet you kept harping on it over and over again that was never an accurate depiction of our conversation here except from your end why do you keep going back to that again and again even though it was already explained to you over and over these are not the people included in this by me that shows me that you are at a loss here for understanding because your not even talking about the original point still anyway your just looking for a way to be right its not working good luck have a nice day bet you cant wish me the same probably because you have your head stuck too far up your own butt nothings being accomplished here byebye im not responding anymore dennis cavagnaro one more thingnhttpsmfacebookcomstoryphpstoryfbid3629835103693228id100000003214204 dennis cavagnaro lets not play mind games your resorting to using the crazy card the  all these things are in your head play its a cheap shot and disrespectful i havent used it on you i could have but didnt and whose a burden not sure of what people you are referring to if your back to those who arent doing what theyre should be doing again we already covered that so im signing out now dennis because this could go on forever and im sure we both have or should have better things to do with our time right now take care wishing you well dennis cavagnaro yes i went to college and have enrolled again to further my education even more yes ive had skill training from a teenager till now and continue to teach myself whatever i can on my own like computer skills office programs etc im constantly in between other family responsibilities in life etc women often are active in learning new things in the process of trying to teach myself how to have an online business to make extra cash etc not a lot of cash but hopefully some not sure if it will work out but trying im at end stage renal kidney disease refusing to go on disability thus far although i qualify taking care of a seriously disabled family member among other things so you see dennis everyone has their story its not all cut and dry like you think im sure youd like to find a way to invalidate the real struggles people are having but knowing personal things about me does not subtract from that people face real life everyday everyone is trying to survive what wage do you pay to those who work for you and what do they do lets start there  dennis cavagnaro your the one straw manning you still have not talked about the original point made or addressed it thats ok its late hope you can come to understand one day i still would like to see the 2019 chart though if you ever find one you claim it would tell a different story would like to see it for sure take care dennis cavagnaro yes but once again im not talking about those who are refusing you keep going there why is that of course rewards based on performance are a good thing however we both know it doesnt always work that way you have no arguement from me about a person doing everything they should and can to be as self sufficient as they can be through  their own will if they can but no one gets there alone no one those who say they do lie we are not born into this world alone we all exist together im a firm believer that the world is a better place when people work together to lift each other up this is what i practice in my own life when i can and or its reasonable to do so  dennis cavagnaro dennis cavagnaro see its not always about money or shouldnt be we all live in this great country and we all should be able to enjoy natural resources like an ocean waterfront even if your homeless you sound as if you disagree with that by what you said dennis cavagnaro some landlords there are some landlords out there that are fair and care about their tets i know of one such good landlord that assessed her fices and decided not to raise rent on a single mother and her children who she knew was a hard working person trying to do the right things in life so that she could keep that tet who was an excellent tet if she had raised the rent the woman and her kids would have needed to find another apartment the landlord did not want that she was also living in the same building and was alone herself and felt safe with this woman and her children there as tets so whats wrong with that i know another landlord who deducted a whole months rent from a tets rent because they ran into a big emergency with their vehicle and the landlords gave them a break otherwise they would have had been evicted the landlord would have lost what they considered to be their best tet per their own words these were private property owners  neither of these tets ever abused that generosity and these two landlords didnt charge crazy out of control rents d homeless people have ocean front views so who says you cant be homeless and have an ocean point view in this country the rich dont or shouldnt own ocean front views the ocean is there or should be there for everyone to enjoy no one should own it or have private rights to an ocean front view so what if they have an ocean front view what a blessing it is that anyone gets to wake up hearing the sound of our lovely ocean you nor anyone else should own those spots they should be for everyone to enjoy camp out a little if they want as long as they are respecting the place do you think only those with money should be able to buy those spots i certainly dont dennis cavagnaro show me a different chart that reflects what your sayingn also again i was not talking about those who arent helping themselves so focusing on that is not an accurate thing to do but you keep coming back to it but with that in mind i do believe in having a safety net to help those in need however i do agree that the way the welfare system is set up can entrap people even more and it can become a never ending cycle from generation to generation for those who want to get ahead trying to avoid taking welfare is crucial however sometimes people fall through the cracks women and children and yes there are abuses of the system but lets talk about those who want to get ahead are doing everything right and still cant afford a roof over their head because of greedy landlords etc whose rental prices are way too high etc maybe the government would not have to shell out so much money to subsidize rent for some people if some of these greedy landlords would be more realistic and not do greedy and have reasonable prices thats just one issue and i dont believe there should be a housing project lumping poor people all together isolating them from those who arent poor is not a good idea make housing the poor more integrative  dennis cavagnaro the point is there are those really trying in life doing everything they can and the deck is stacked against them right away you think about those who dont want to take responsibility for themselves i was not talking about those people they get what comes thats life so im not sure why your choosing to go to that place because i made it clear they are not who im talking about and yet you keep coming back to that thats because your trying to pigeonhole me there is individualism and it is highly valued in our country by people but we are also a country which includes many and perhaps your confused about what im saying because your trying to pigeonhole me and paint me as a socialist of which i am not i think thats where your confusion is coming in this country is supposed to be the land of opportunity you havent answered my question have you read dear americanhere it isnits a little bit of education on whats going on in the world nhave a good daynnhttpswwwbusinessinsidercomdearamericayoushouldbemadashellaboutthischarts20126ampaoh15975088545076referrerhttps3a2f2fwwwgooglecomamptffrom2025124sn dennis cavagnaro and no meanness intended but im assuming that you dont have all of the answers either dennis cavagnaro ok im not for advocating for dependency however you still did not address the skills issue which you brought up and while i believe in making ones own way in life it does not fix what is lopsided in our country power run amuck and yes i will be fair and read what you asked what about people who are going or who have gone to college to get more skills or tried to get skills from jobs there has to be some kind of balance to make things fairer for everyone people go to the other extreme sometimes the opposite of what you speak about to try and correct the situation yes thats dangerous and not good but poorer people need the economy and policys to work for them too so that all of those skills that they put many years into trying to get and spending lots of money to accumulate are compensated well where is the compensation have you read dear america from the new york times if i remember correctly thats where its from bottom line i think many people are trying to do as you say and make it in life and make their own way  but the deck is stacked against them in many ways i may not have the answer to everything but i do know that there are good honest fair and responsible people trying to make it in life and raising the minimum wage would be a big help to them where i live the minimum wage is a little over seven dollars thats ludicrous dennis cavagnaro pay fair wages what about the skills section did you read it what do you have to say about that dennis cavagnaro dennis cavagnaron dennis

you have no clue which party i lean more towards or if i lean toward one at all and yet here you are making assumptions using the word royal as the basis for it does that really sound very rational to

966,michael schulman  you are trying to control thenlife of a baby the baby gets no votesomeone needs to defend them now we know why could you be  the  famous  dog walker who has  a lot of medical  opinions  to  share   this was on  cheshire  medical terrible place if you have an emergency or need any type of medical attention youre better off going literally anywhere else the nurses and employees dont care about the patients and it is a very toxic environment i highly recommend your local walk or another hospital out of town this hospital doesnt even deserve 1 star yeah  im  sure you  specialized  in  medicine  in  high school  and learned  a lot  about  reproductive  health  while walking dogs michael schulman the only thing obvious  is  you want to  hide  who  you are   and  you  are the  one  who  lacks  any  understanding  of the  issue  what  is  it about  sucks like  you  who  refuse  to  be  or act  responsibly  and then want  to pass a law  that  really  allows  a  baby  to be  terminated  because  of  inconvience  to the parents  as  covid has  taught  some  of  us    life is  not  convenient  do  you have any education or just  a punk  with  a mouth sandy bishop  so your saying  all poverty is due to medical issues  have you ever worked in a low in one housing development i have  no motivation nonsense of self reliance  sandy bishop  its not being lucky to come from a average lower middle class family  thats twisted logic it is stupid and selfish not to prepare yourself and willfully make yourself a burden if you force companies to over pay for jobs that should be done by high school kids those jobs will be gone how you dont understand that is beyond me  sandy bishop no because i prepared myself for a career  actually three careers and   provided for  my family i was very sick but went to work because thats what people do both my parents worked and my father worked two jobs many years now what about you what did you do sandy bishop  no  jday hilley  the death rate is percent of pop you used this figure as a negative implying it was worse then other states or countriesnh has handled this virus outstandingly we are top 5 and our economy has held together our leadership from our governor has been great not to mention we have a fair amount of nursing homes which are big contributors to virus death stats no violent demonstrations to date  allof this and no across the board income or sales tax  jday hilley a death of 6 would be about 84000 people jday hilley  try using your math    you were referring to the death rate in nh from covid correct well i gave you the general pop figure and the deaths we have had due to covid do the math jday hilley  of the 1400000  or so  people living in nh 430 have died  from  the  disease i get 3100ths of  a percent how do  you get 6 then  you dont mind  the competition  also  there  are  many  reasons  parents  dont want  their children in  public  schools  i wanted  my children  to  learn language  history  science  and  math  and  be  prepared  for a  career  or  to  go  to a  college i dont want  there  time  wasted  with  left wing propaganda  i  want  them task  and  goal oriented  some towns  have  bad  school  systems  and  the people of  that  area should not  be  limited you  claim vouchers arent for the poor people with  means  send  their  kids to private  without vouchers  so the  ones  benefiting  from this  is  the  poor christina ruth  society is in my lane killing a child is on my lane and there is no law on the books that say what you stayed and i want that law my lane got it  randy mosson  no but if you have sex with someone you are part of the equation and the responsibility many abortions happen because a guy takes off leaving the entire situation on the shoulders of one person randy mosson whats wrong with you  you get pregt you ignored bc you put off the decision to the se one tri semester and now you de ode its too inconvenient no no no killing is not the solution here sarah dallaire no one should have the right to kill an unborn child after the first tri semester  pam michael allnwoman and men can get birth control nothing preventing you i  have  twice  and  i forced myself back  to  work  each  time  and  better  things  happen  for  me each  time  life  is  a battle  there  will  always  be  challenges take  on  those  challenges and  you will be  amazed  at  what  you can  do    what  is  the  excuse  for  not  acquiring more job skills  the elderly and  handicapped  are  mostly  covered  by  disability  ssi  and  retirement  being  envious oif of those  who succeed  instead  of using  them  as  an  example of  hard  work  and  effort  only passes  the issue  to  the next  generation   burger  flipping are  jobs  for  kids sandy bishop  first  the successful people make millions because they earned their millions stop with the class warfare second why should anyone pay more for something then the market demands you blame the rich you claim its welfares job why arent we blaming the people who are lazy and didnt prepare for life in the first place there is no excuse for not preparing yourself to be an adult and certainly no reason a young adult cant work and go to school or training program and better themselves  jayne van loon  httpswwwcnncomvideoscnnmoney20180306flippyburgergrillingrobotfastfoodorigcnn  jayne van loon  why cant people learn more skills you are allowing them to live a lie letting them think their going to have much of a life flipping burgers those jobs are going to be automated  pete rice  no its about local conditions nyc is not rural nh florida has beaches south dakota does not if you read  the constitution you would know that these type of issues are to be handled locally   pete rice  it belongs locally i never understand why people want everything from the fed schools local rents local covid procedures local rita broughall what we need is a voucher system that gives parents the opportunity to choose there schools sheryl petra  it depends on if the wage is equivalent to the skills education and market demand of the job if it takes xyz to recruit a person for a particular job and that is livable great  if say you can recruit burger flippers all day long for 10 dollars and thats what you budget but the government makes you pay 15 then the five dollars is mandated not earned and eventually that burger joint will find a way to hire less  people the person didnt earn the five extra dollars with his qualifications thats not how a free market economy works and there is no reason to subsidize burger flippers ryan rezendes  ryan has a degree in facebook at least that one deb forgot to put a space before the link  debbie wilson  sheeeessss back   debbie wilson  now you go potty mouth ran out of excuses i guess you missed the point so i need to repeat  government was never intended to save your ass its up to you the quicker people come to that understanding the better you didnt wish me a nice day  you lied  or you wouldnt have gone potty mouth you hate this because in some deep place in your brain you know im right debbie wilson  cant open it  debbie wilson  you ran out of ideas many posts ago where does the money come from to provide all the assistance to those who choose dependency thats right a passive choice  ignoring the advise and counsel of making one better prepared for life is passively passing that burden to someone else one simple act does not place one in welfare for life a series of irresponsible decision over years does  ryan rezendes  you have so little idea about what you are talking about i worked in low income areas for years have  you worked anywhere for years  have you provided services ran any poverty programs   the safety net is not socialism when its designed to provide temporary assistance so people can get back on their feet  once you assume welfare for life and get second and third generation of poverty you are leaving the safety net and entering living of government for ever  it starts to be come psychological  now you are a expert  in survivorship because you find some article in wiki    go out and live for a few decades  raise a family  go thru a few life challenges those of us who have the degree of discomfort and pain that you need to absorb to get through tough times again another  strawmani  did not  say  it  was  cut  and  dry  all these  things  are in  your  head for what  ever  reason i  dont  invalidate  peoples  struggles   nor  do  i  invalidate  my  own they are  our  struggles  and  its  part  of  our life  and  its our  task  to manage  them without  becoming  a burden  im  retired no  one works  for  me the times that  i  managed staff  they got paid  the going  rate  which is  determined  by the  skills sets  required  of the  position and  the  amount  needed  to recruit  them  doesnt that  sound fair that is  all  i am  really  saying here the issue is  there  are  jobs that dont  involve  many  skills and  were  never  intended for  someone  to raise  a family on they were  intended  for high  school  kids retired people adding to the  cash flow second jobs for  people  who need to  offset some  expense or save for  kids college  etc  the kindest thing you can do to  someone who  thinks  that job  is  the  answer  to taking  care of  their  family is  tell  them its  not  now you know this  because  you  are  reenrolled  in college i have had serious  heart  surgery i could have  taken  disability  as 80 of people  in my  condition have i did not would not  instead  i  went  back to  work and  had the  most successful 10  years  of  my working  life  i still do  all  my activities  i feel very good  and  content about  that i  have been  on a  deathbed multiple times and  know  what thoughts  go thru my head i dont  want to rob  a person of the great  feeling  of independence and  self sufficiency  its  what america is  all about  debbie wilson  you gave  charts  that  ended  in 2016 you know  very  well  the  unemployment rate  was  3537  earlier this  year  thats a  fact  you  go look  it  up  btw  its  strawman  not  one  straw    what  did you  do  for  work did you  go to  school  take instruction is a  skill  program how did  you prepare  to take  care of yourself  well thats  the  effort  everyone  should  be doing  not asking  for  artificially higher  wages     nothing free  for  me sounds like  a left wing  moocher  goverment  isnt  there  to  give you  free  stuff debbie wilson  dont strawman  we cant pay for all of it  debbie wilson  if you refuse to participate in the productivity of any society you may require basic necessities but that doesnt translate to the best seat in house in general merit not need based produces better results  trump  offered risk  protection  in  his  latest bill  that  the  dems  refuse  to  hear  they  want  more  money  for  bailouts  and  planned  parenthood  ljoel hackbart  i get it left wing guy bitching  about other peoples success and wants free stuff from government no pride in achievement no sense of self reliance  just give me my portion as the looter on tv said the other day  ljoel hackbart really tell me about the uk debbie wilson well i was agreeing with you until  greedy landlords  did you ever coincided buying a rental property what return in your investment would you want to put up with the breakage noise maintece that goes with renting to strangers  i agree on your housing project assessment but in sine areas of the country homeless have ocean front views your  charts  if  they  were  extended  to 2019  would tell  a  different  story i am  th3e  grand child of immegrants  who came  here legally  with  nothing im not  pigeon  holing anyone  our  world has  now  reach  the point  where  we cant reward  pure  labor  without skills anymore   those  jobs  are  gone  btw  i worked in subsidized  housing  for  years  i  know  that story  first  hand most  not  all  didnt  put  in  a  daily  effort  to  improve  their  situation   whether it  was  drugs  or  alcohol  or pure  laziness  bad parenting  etc  you  did not  see any  drive  and determination in  their  day to  day  behavior  welfare  programs  are  set up  to  reenforce  not  confront  poverty  the poverty rate  in the  sixies  was about  16 today  after  spending  billions  and  insitutuing  hundreds  of government  funded  programs  you  know  what  iy  is  16  you cant buy  motivation   the answer  always  lies  with  the  individual  im  trying to  undertsand  your  point  here you  are saying  people are  getting  degrees  and  skills  and there  are  no jobs  that wasnt the  case  at  all  last march and  you  cant  take  a  disease  like  covid  shut down  a  economy  and  not  expect  unemployment  herman  cain was the  son  of  a  poor domestic worker and sharecropper  he had nothing  yet he  took responsibility  and  studied and  went to  college  and  became  the  great  man he  was besos son  of a  16  year old single  mother ben  carson etc at the  age  of 16  every child  needsw  to report  to  a  counselor  and told thisin two years you  are  an adult you are  fully  resonsible responsible for  your  food shelter  and  life what are  you planes  and if  you  dont know  lets  put together  a  plan and options if you  dont we aint bailing  you  out i hear kids  crying that their  stressed  all  the  time  what stress you want stress  trying raising  kids when  you  are  unemployed  in a down  economy many people dotry surviving  cancer    or  my favorite is  that  scene in the  beginning of  saving  private  ryan where a  17 year  old boy was shaking as he leaned  against the  landing boat door about  to hit  the beach knowing when  that door  dropped bullets  were going  to be flying  in killing  half the  people  in the  boat now thats  stress no fed  program gonna  bail him out you see  debbie there  will  always be  more  people   who rather  not work  hard  rthen  willing to always be more  losers  then  winners  more people scared  then  brave life will never  be  fair  people  are  born with different skills and  talents  heights  and weights but if  you  place  those  in charge  that  pander to the  lost instead  of inspiring if  you reward need instead of  merit  you  will have  a country of unproductiveness  and  misery with  no one left  to recue   ljoel hackbart  apparently the  carriers  arent affecting  europe  too much  we are  not  the  first  country  doing  this  you live  in  nh right you  would  be  really  freaking  out if you lived  in  california  or  texas greater chance  of  children  dying being transported  to  school  then  from  the covid  look it  up 700000  die from  cancer  each  year  stop the  drama wear a  mask  keep  a  safe distance  and  stop looking  for  a  mommy  government  to save  you debbie wilson  very little real data and it says right up front a position paper it blatantly states that we should take hard earned money from successful people that we should increase taxes to help illegal immigrants as if its our responsibility to bail out rather then prevent people from illegally crossing our boarders and using our resources its clearly socialist doctrine and im sure in the early 2000s some  venezuelan professor  pushed this crap to a few corrupt politicians and started the decline of the best functioning economy in south america its the charge and responsibility of each individual to secure hisher place in society you cant mandate drive and determination that needs to be developed thru families and local communities go read rands atlas shrugged  to see how these government managed economies go off the tracks no pun intended debbie wilson  excessive unemployment before covid we had nearly zero unemployment also this is purely socialist in presentation you want the government to have the power to set wages  have you ever read the constitution do you understand why europe has floundered and the united states has gone from a few starving pilgrims to the world leading economy in less the 250 years  debbie wilson government should not have the power to force wages on business try learning more skills if you want money  dolores fay i get tired of  moaners who complain about their salary but didnt put in the work to qualify themselves for a higher wage everyone want stuff for free you came to nh for a less hectic life and lower taxes and there you go wanting free stuff ron cereola  government  involvement is not all or nothing  but we need to keep the hands of politicians off free market enterprise as much as possible i did object with the most if the 08 bailout  especially the gm  intervention the drama haunting 247 mainstreamnmedia blew this whole story out of proportion i also disagree with the current stimulus packages supported by either side  we went from a country that rationed and sacrificed  for over 4 years to fight a life threatening war2  and came out of that a stronger country no one wants to wait 6 months today thats the result of decades of breeding dependence and victim hood life gets difficult  there will always be challenges ron cereola  straw man  i have said nothing about anti trust  and where i live i only have one phone company and one internet  anyway last i looked apple was doing fine ron cereola  i agree and dont think i said there was a distinction these jobs used to be staffed by these groups  government interference with artificially setting wages higher then the productivity they provide  has already spurred robotics and  process changes to reduce  jobs in those areas  is that what we want heck i rather provide a work experience to younger people  ron cereola the wage is set by what is enough to fill the position skills work conditions availability of talent are all factors  socialist countries like sweden dont have  state minimum wage per se the misuse of setting minimums began when obama tried to sell burger wrapping jobs to boost his employment numbers no one in their right mind would expect to raise a family of 4 wrapping burgers so i say lets do that misguided person a favor lets tell him the truth  he needs more skills  then we should make schools focus more on job training andnlife skills then we wouldnt need to screw around with the free market regarding wage setting ron cereola higher or different nothing noble about labor its tied to our survival instincts hungry  you grab a piece of fruit but when government who produces nothing by itself attempts to dictate wages and not allow the free market  to determine the value of labor thats when you lose opportunity you lose ambition and the country loses productivity  minimum wage jobs  should be for high school students or people looking for additional work no one should be retiring as a burger wrapper after 40 years  somehow that person needs pressure to increase his skill set  true wage is set by what someone is willing to pay you want a higher wage  go get the skills to qualify life is a competitive world come big or stay home freakin babies out there only by competition will we get better schools driven to help kids be successful in life why did i have to go and search to know this money is aimed at minorities and

1104,thomas bergin iii i  think  what  he  means  is  that  mass  folks  wouldnt  bother  to  drive  up  here  for  goods  that are taxed  as  they  are  down  there  some  shoppers come  from  quite  a  distance  now    this would seem  to  negatively  impact  nh  businesses    plus  pretty  much  every  state  that  has  gone  this  route  has or  is  failing  fiscally    the  science  says  dont do  it  you  will  regret  it    and  there  will  be  no  going  back    instead  of  following  the  other  nitwit  states  lets  be leaders and  show   the rest of  the  country how  to  do it right   lillian cabanalawson so  untrue  many  private  schools  bend  over  backwards  to  help  poorer  families  send  their  kids    pretty  sure  you  didnt didnt research  that  comment  and  if we  allowed  vouchers  that would  help  even  more  of  the  poorer  families  send  their  kids  to  better  schools   or  at  least  let parents  choose  charter  schools     n bernadette halloran i believe  the  original intent  of  separation  of  church  and state was meant to  prevent government from  interfering with church  worship and prevent  government  from  establishing  one  official  religion  this  is  specifically  why the  pilgrims  left  europe  where  that  was the  norm   unfortunately this  original  intent  has been morphed into  something  clearly  not  intended  by  the  founders     n  i  appreciate  your  defense  of  public  schools    i  come  from  a  family  of public  school  teachers  mother  grandparents uncle  niece  and  other  remote relatives    i  was  also  educated  in a   public school  but  after  my children  went  to  public school  for  several  years  my  wife  and  i  decided  to  homeschool  and  then  go  to private school  for  high  school   you see  public  school  is  not what  it  once  was  yes  there are  a  few  good  ones  here  and there   but and  large the education  has declined and  furthermore  the  values most  parents would like  their children to  learn  cannot  be  found  in  most  public  schools  furthermore the content has clearly  become  a  form of indoctrination    this is why so  many  young  folks believe  that  socialism is a viable form of  government   they  are  learning  this  in our  high schools and colleges  common core is one the problems  lately  their is a move called the 1619 project  please  look  that up  and i dont blame the  teachers for most  of this   school  administration officials need to act with  courage  and responsibility to our children  to protect them from this type of bad education  but they seem either unwilling or unable  that is specifically why so many of us are willing to pay more money to send our kids to private  school even if some of the opportunities arent as good regarding different types of classes  at  least good morals are taught and emphasized  please dont try to  defend public schools on this account  i have way  too much experience on this front as well as  does  anyone who  deals with both the public school vs private  schoolhomeschooled  products  the truth is quite self evident  and if you would like to see how separation of church and state began there  is a link  below  it was  never addressed in our constitution  as you seem to infer  nnhttpswwwlocgovloclcib9806danprehtml why is  it  that people  do not  understand  that  a  living  wage  or  increase  in  the  minimum wage only  burdens   business owners   they are  forced to  respond  by  raising  prices  cutting  hours  for  workers  or  laying  some  off   have  we  already  forgotten that before covid  the  unemployment  rate  was  at  an  all time  low and  employers were having  difficulty  finding  workers  wages  went  up  free market worked   ask  bernie  the  socialist sanders  what  his  campaign  had  to  do  when he  had to  meet  a  minimum  wage  standard  didnt  work  out  so  well  for  his  campaign  workers   more government  more problems    live  free or die   reta matthewschaffee macgregor thats cause  all  the  crazy  folks  live  in  mass sue donovan actually renters  do  pay  real  estate  taxes  indirectly    the rent  would be  cheaper  if  the  landlord  paid less  in  property  taxes   it  is  like  people  who  think  they get a  deal when  they use  their  credit  card and  get  points   what  they  dont  realize  is  that  all the businesses  who  accept credit  cards have  to  pay visa and  mastercard mastercard a fee  they  pass it on  to the  consumer  pretty neat  trick  same  for  renters  fees   n    the  people  who  pay  the  most  in taxes  in  nh  are  those  with  nice big  houses  generally  the rich   nh is one of the  most friendly states for  retired  folksdont  take  my  word  research  yourself  n  retarding  income  tax  that  is  just one more way for the government  the  inefficient government to  get their  hooks  in  our  wallets   research what  happened to  those states who  implemented an  income tax  started small then grew  how about we  not let that camel get its nose under the tent sununu  has  been  the  only  major  politician  working to keep  us  from  becoming  massachusettes  please  people  think  long  and  hard  before  you  vote    remember  the  principles that  made  our  country  great  and  vote  for  those  who  honor  those  principles   live  free or die does  anyone  know  how many  schoolaged  children  have died  from  covid  in  nh there are only  two  things i cant  stand  people  who  are  intolerant

1175,ginger rojas right exactly why we dont want corky or mowers carpetbaggers be gone  wayne garfield yes thanks for asking i do know what the bill is the current districts have been gerrymandered  the district i live in is coupled with another town that to visit requires a 30 minute drive through 2 other towns as there are no connecting roads there are many other districts that have been put together for the soul purpose of favoring one party  nfair redistricting without bias and influence from the parties is reasonable the only reason sununu would veto this is that he recognizes the unfairness and wants to keep the rigged system   if you dont want to use the public option you can choose to go to private school funding that privately  should you also decide that you dont like other state or federal services i guess you could try to build your own roads hire a private police or fire crew do your own food safety evaluations and opt out of any other public government programs  i would not expect the government to fund any of these choices you make for your personal services thank you mr pappas you are so right  these public funds should stay with the public schools and focus on students in the public system we currently have a governor and a commissioner of education who do not care about the public school system and are taking the current pandemic as an opportunity to defund schools daniel busa property taxes are a a big problem we need to consider widening the tax base so the burden isnt on homeowners  it doesnt make sense to have such dependence on this one tax source if you cant wincheat nvote him out,3,6.626499999999999,3.92,62.83,

1178,put  them on      bernadette halloran   thats the problem bernadette  you dont even know what  our freedoms are laurie thomas koch   your opinion only  not mine gail gaudet henry   its not killing a child its doing away with an embryo that had no business being fertilized laura spottiswood   and i respect your stand but we must all stand for the common good even if we dont like all the details  women need to progress to having intelligent pregcies for the right reasons  our future generations depend on it  having unplanned unwanted pregcies not only drags us down as women but as society as a whole   fred decicco  i was harking back to a time when there were good republicans  they had a welldefined philosophy you could actually comprehend  the present republicans are something different and maybe should be referred to as the party of trump fred decicco  i was harking back to a time when there were good republicans  they had a welldefined philosophy you could actually comprehend  the present republicans are something different and maybe should be referred to as the party of trump   and just when i was thinking what a good republican he is he comes out with this crap  do we have to just vote all republicans out of office to get a fresh start  i guess so gail gaudet henry   of course its their choice  but who pays the price when there are unwanteduncared for children  we the taxpayers do  thats not fair to the child and its sure not fair to the taxpayers  abortion is not a simple issue with simplistic solutions  of course its horrible  and we can all get so saintly with our declarations that its wrong but unwanted pregcies are also wrong  when a child is not loved properly its everybodys problem   lets vote him away too  hes disrespecting nh    becky fallon soule   nobody is justifying murder but no youre wrong  there are women who do not have the ability to be responsible   laura spottiswood   i believe basic healthcare is for the common good  everybody benefits when were all in good health  and that includes reproductive health  youre making it sound like a yes no situation  its not   alan doyon   and btw you are clouding the issue when you talk about open borders  nobody wants that  what we need are immigration laws with teeth  weve needed that for a long time and because we dont have them we have the chaos you see  what we should be asking is why in 4 years time has djt failed to provide the new immigration laws he promised us   alan doyon   well then  djt promised us comprehensive immigration reform  that means laws  hes been around 4 years and we have no immigration reform  what we have are executive orders which will expire when the new president is sworn in  what we have in djt is cruelty toward immigrants scaring immigrants with ice separating 2000 children from their parents at the border and putting them behind fences  that is unamerican  we do need comprehensive immigration reform but djt is unable to get it done  he cant get along with anyone long enough to actually craft laws  same with healthcare  promises made    promises broken  now healthcare and immigration reform were trumps biggest promises to us  i dont know what people are talking about when they say he has kept promises  hes a failure alan doyon no not all democrats bonnie mcdermott   in some cases that means the woman has no choice   i dont recognize the republican party anymore and unless it evolves back into what it was ill never vote republican again  and im not too happy about the democrats either  im going to stay independent till a better choice emerges   becky fallon soule   i agree but what about a mentally challenged girl who gets pregt who doesnt have the ability to be responsible use preventive therapies  things arent as simple as youre laying it out to be   laura spottiswood  you have the right to protest  of course  but not deny her that choice bob burns no way yes  guess he doesnt want to draw attention to anything trump would disapprove of  but he should trump disrespected new hampshire  why isnt sununu speaking out about that  wouldnt it have been incredible for nh and sununu if he had enforced it and the first person to be removed from the rally was trump himself  maybe in handcuffs  sununu would go down in history rich colcombe   i think youre confused a bit  wearing a mask does not protect you but the people you come in contact with  it prevents your droplets from getting into the air  thats why i think its so disrespectful when others refuse to wear one  they are announcing that they dont care whether or not you breathe the same air they do  and since there are so many infected people who do not know it and may never know its really important  sounds like youre doing just fine  youre right  stressing about what others do or dont do is fruitless but this is a big deal and it just pisses me off that others are so irresponsible   when trump took office morals and morality went out the window  he has cheapened our public discourse and made it ok for the white supremacists kkk nazis and racists to openly trash our country   rich colcombe   yes and we want it to stay that way  however some of trumps cult members dont understand what it means to do something for the common good  not because someone is forcing you to but because you want to do whats best for everyone  you could compare it to the rules of the road  you follow the rules to make for a safe driving experience for everyone  but when you decide to risk others lives by say driving 120 mph on a 2lane road if you dont kill someone first probably an officer will stop you and youll get a fine  there should be enforcement of the mask mandate  its for the common good bobbie thomas   yeah theyre either dead or waiting for rescue from their roofs  not in a position to kiss his ring laura spottiswood  they do basic blood workups testing for hiv  followup for hiv basic gynecological services pap smears they treat infections birth control  and when a woman asks for an abortion many options are laid out for her and intensive counselling ensues  yes abortion is so extreme and morally wrong for many of us but a woman lives the rest of her life with the decision she makes  do you because of your beliefs have the right to deny her any choice she makes  actually i think abortions will become more and more rare  if all a woman needs do to prevent a pregcy is take a pill why would any sane woman proceed with a pregcy if she didnt want a child   about funding  say youre violently opposed to the death penalty your tax dollars still pay for the means to kill the condemned  our tax dollars are to be spent on the common good  you may disagree on whats good and whats not but those tax dollars include everybody    laura spottiswood   no its not their main function  many women would have no health care at all if it werent for pp  abortions are none of anybodys business unless youre a woman who needs one or wants to discuss her options  not everyone shares your views on abortion  its completely up to the woman and her dr   have to clean my toilet sorry say it aint so yeah  like you think hes going to answer our questions  he speaks only predigested lies   jhonathon kunesch   yes but in the face of no national leadership sununu was doing pretty well  but he needs to change his stance on this mask and distancing issue  he needs to mandate it  we dont want covid in our state  weve had enough  look  its not forever but if we dont keep zipped up so many more are going to die  my husband just died in a nursing home not from covid and i saw what they went through to keep the virus out  its no fun but we need to back up and start taking this much more seriously  and the economy isnt going to come back till we deal with it  so why are we acting like spoiled teenagers  we need grownups to lay down the law  governor  i used to think so tell the governor to keep him out of nh  he has disrespected our state bob burns   hey bob  you forgot to mention hillarys emails and baraks birth certificate sununu  why didnt you mandate mask wearing  its not threatening anyones freedom  the people who defy common sense and wont wear a mask are threatening my freedom to maintain my health  when someone yells fire in a crowded theater isnt that comparable to this situation  you can enjoy your freedom but dont prevent me from enjoying mine  and since simple courtesy isnt in vogue anymore isnt it time to mandate it  and when the president wants to come back just tell him masks are mandated here  wear one or stay out  and when he doesnt  arrest him  youd sure get a lot of positive press out of that sununu  why dont you be more assertive with the president  we dont appreciate his disrespectful attitude toward nh  you just have to stay in  your reward  you probably wont get covid   so whats going to happen to the unmasked  nothing  seems trump is the law  just follow the cult leader  i think someone should tell him to stay out of nh if he cant follow simple rules  he disrespected nh   look  we are doing fairly well here in nh keeping the infections at bay  but i think we would be doing ourselves a favor if we just dont show up for this rally  vote for whomever you wish but lets show the rest of the country how we keep our infection rate down  just say no to rallies alexander cali   it really doesnt apply to nh now but it could in the future  redistricting frequently causes gerrymandering which is arbitrarily drawing lines around an electoral district which favors one party or another  many states have done it and many people think it won trump the election  it really needs to be done away with as it usually disfavors low income folks johnny green   based on what  whats your proof oh that is too bad  i too was thinking good thoughts about the smart decisions he was making about covid19 was thinking he must be an independent thinkforhimself republican  if he makes it harder to vote for anyone guess ill have to change my mind about him  ,3,9.8648,5.8,62.97,

get so smart peter smith youve already made it political but whatever the president acted before anyone when he stopped flights from china  joe biden called him a xenopbobe for doing it saint fauci whom all you libs think is the only person on earth worth listening too was saying the virus wasnt a threat to the united states weeks and months later andrew cuomo was ordering nursing homes to admit covid positive patients when he knew full well that the elderly were uniquely susceptible to the virus the governer of florida among others knowing how vulnernable the elderly are ordered the opposite he ordered that covid positive patients not be admitted into nursing homes cuomo was also telling people to go out and live their lives and not worry about the virus cy pelosi was telling people to go the chinese festival there are more examples but i hope you get my point nas far as the president having a plan for a pandemic thats not something that each president has a specific plan for the government has protocols in place that are enacted automatically regardless of who the president is at the time if youre going to point fingers perhaps you should look at the stockpiles of ppe etcthat your liberal messiah obama left depleted let me ask you what should the president have done differently every governer in the country cuomo included said that the federal response to their requests was excellent even saint fauci said it was impressive none more thing the president never called the virus a hoax he was obviously referring to the medias criticism of his handling of the situation if he indeed believed it was a hoax why did he talk about it at the state of the union  kathleen doherty whitham because there are many other well credentialed and respected individuals from prestigious institutions that have the opposite opinion  peter smith thats exactly my point cuomo and others deliberately put covid positive people into nursing homes when they knew full well that it was extremely dangerous to the elderly kathleen doherty whitham which scientists peter smith though a great number of deaths nationwide did occur in nursing homes the vast majority of governers with the exceptions of ny and nj and possibly one or two others did not mandate by executive order that nursing homes admit wuhan positive patients into their facilities quite the opposite in other states notably floridanso in answer to your question yes in cases where governers deliberately put nursing home residents in harms way the blame falls on those particular governors dom feroce go play in your room the adults are talking peter smith i know how it got into new york nursing homes andrew cuomo mandated it hes personally responsible for tens of thousands of deaths michelle anderson so let me get this straight you who are not a doctor can lecture me who is also not a doctor nobody but you is allowed to have an opinion peter smith when exactly did i say its only the elderly ive simply pointed out which population is at the greatest risk michelle anderson ok stalker i mean michelle saint fauci isnt the only scientist on earth there are many respected and well credentialed epidemiologists that have the exact opposite opinion the difference between fauci and others is that fauci has been a federal beaurocrat for fifty years and cant get enough of the media fawning over him sonia prince couldnt and shouldnt  lorna arcand ignorant am i why dont you dazzle us all with your superior intellect  lauren merrill thompson 8590 thats absurd if that were true places like california would have very little spread nlet me ask you this since its not likely that this virus is going away and a vaccine may never come whats going to happen to all you people whove been hiding under your beds destroying your immune systems are you going to expect those of us with robust immune systems to wear masks forever ann noll because the democrats and the media one and the same have demagogued and fear mongered everyone into a panic lauren merrill thompson yes everyone should go back to living their lives  lauren merrill thompson so im still waiting for your evidence youll have to forgive me that im not willing to believe some rando on facebook because they say masks work in preventing the spread of a virus so tiny it can only been seen with an electron microscopenhey ive got some chain link fencing for you to keep mosquitoes awayneducate myselfnplease pam poirier my price of doing whats that supposed to mean mark flynn wow good one youre a heck of a debater smart how whats your education plan lauren merrill thompson thats absurd theres no evidence that masking prevents the spread if it worked so well why did california have such large death numbers they were locked down and masked up the whole time they still are in fact cindy currie so we should not educate our children for how long exactly because of a virus with a risk factor thats statistically insignificantnthe rest of society can go back to work with the exception of teachers why cindy currie show me one place on earth where masking has been proven to prevent the spread of wuhan virus you libs yes i called you a lib are always spouting off about following the science well lets follow the science unless a person is elderly andor has comorbidities  the risk is very small the average age of death from wuhan virus is 78 the average age of death in general is also 78 this virus is nowhere near as dangerous as you demagogues on the left would have everyone believe great so the lib teachers can all not teach and lib parents can keep their kids home while america loving conservative teachers return to work and teach the children of parents who understand that the risk to school age children is statistically insignificantnwin win,3,2.7841,0.0,100.0,0.0

to the republicans affected by the lake travis tragedy  rememberdumbkirk rememberbowlinggreenmassacre john crane james alex fields jr  was the name you were looking for  if you are going to try lying at least try using convincing names  im done talking with nazis like you  good day john crane deny defend deflect  he was at a unite the right rally  lots of little neonazi trumpers there  you need to stop your lying  if thats even possible for a trumper  bill mackay just another putin ass kisser  will you be leaving for russia when the orange shit stain looses  or are you going to rebrand yourself as a libertarian  fucking republicans sold out our nation to russia bill mackay  yep youre just stupid enough to be a trump supporter bill mackay   after hearing how trump has disrespected our veterans how could anyone vote for a republican vote blue no matter who john crane i know that the republicans were closeted racists and theyve been emboldened by herr trump to come out  how else can you explain swastikas and white supremacist symbols at every single trump gathering  you cant  you know it to be true but you cant bring yourselves to condemn or distance yourselves from trump  with you republicans its party over country common decency and humanity   sunono  john crane you republicans cant hide from your nazi identity  those tiki torch carrying assholes shouting jews shall not replace us were trump supporting republicans  gene danforth  again  how many of those unadoptable children will you provide a home to  youre a god fearing christian arent you  time to step up to the plate and put your money where your mouth is or stfu  oh and explain to us how youre going to force rape victims to carry their attackers children denise tuccolo  there are plenty of kids out there that are never adopted  your argument falls flat  it falls even flatter for kids with a handicap  and again  would you be willing to force a woman to give birth to a baby she did not want  how would you do that  chain her to the bed for 9 months  jail people for getting abortions  would you force women to seek abortions in back alleys like the days of old  your viewpoint is no better than the taliban gene danforth how much if a tax increase are you willing to stomach to care for all the unborn  30  maybe a sales tax to help house those kids that no one will adopt    brenda fifield  religion is like a vagina  its ok to be proud of it certainly ok to use it  generally its frowned upon when you whip it out in public denise tuccolo oh really  that statement doesnt actually jibe with reality  its even less accurate if we are talking about babies with downs syndrome or other handicaps  and lets just examine your ridiculous statement a little bit further  so youre willing to force a rape vitim to have her attackers child  is that what youre proposing   john crane  youre a republican which means that youre forever wed to the qanon hysteria the neonazis and all the other whack jobs that have taken over the gop  congratulations  how does it feel to be a conspiracy believing fascist lunatic john crane  typical republican deny deflect defend   edward munroe  how high are you willing to let your tax burden increase to so that the unborn can live  simple question  kenneth lehtonen more qanon bullshit  how many unborn are you going to pay for out of your tax dollars  simple question   john crane yep im sure its a result of some great democratic cabal that is satan worshipping and eats the unborn reich randy mosson lack of insight and being brainwashed into being good little fascists  jeremy daigle not really  according to your boy trump all mexicans are rapists criminals and ms13 members  now that is some strange shit  but really not surprising  youre now wed to

republican being spoon fed on lies and disinformation  vlad loves your kind  jason lee qanon batshit crazy strikes again jeremy daigle straight is there some reason why trump voters have problem with

 stupidity is certainly fertile ground for the average despot jeremy daigle  steve aiken the word youre looking for is know  if youre going to post nonsense at least get the spelling right mildred

believing that there will be trickle down  the only trickle down you idiots get is a golden shower republicans lost all credibility the moment they chose trump and continue to back him  the current

i know children are more important that old people  vonnie sipple esielionis if you care about the future stop taking what you hear from cable and network news sources as the truth they are all owned by global corporations do some research on an issue and dig deep into it and you will discover theyre lying and they are pushing an agenda once you see the lies for yourself it will change your whole perspective vonnie sipple esielionis democrats are literally letting criminals burn down their cities so they can blame trump it obvious to anyone with an objective mind jeanne stapleton you sound like you dont like children hopefully youre not a teacher linda charbonneau china is the real threat not russia biden has disturbing history with china obama laughed at the idea that russia was a threat now democrats are obsessed with russia that horse is dead vonnie sipple esielionis stay in power how long has biden been in office trumps huge 4 year dictatorship  jeff swett youre all wrapped up emotionally i can tell by howninsulting you are the ability to engage with someone who disagrees without insulting them is big brain stuff jeff swett if you think russia is the major threat to the usa and not china you are completely out of touch joe robbins i doubt your level of confidence due to the bye bye now thing on the end im scared about whats going on i think you understand why james mulligan republicans have become so bad that decades long serving democrats are innocent heros in this grand fight to take down orange man jeff mclaird you guys i misspelled something on facebook read your comment and reflect on how strange it is diane allen schlott we need like 12 joe robbins which law do you speak of 2a no support for that democrats want to get rid of police and not let you have a gun to protect yourself and loved ones  immigration law nope democrats dont support that i guess they want cheap undocumented labor america first trade deals nope they like cheap asian slave labor democrats are disgusting and an embarrassment to this country jeff swett you like communism sharon nielsen it will be normal when we decide to act normal please dont think im heartless my hearts broken right now so much suffering happening fear is growing like a cancer and is hurting so many stephanie loupee its the truth out of the top 20 most dangerous cities only 1 is run by a republican 17 democrats and 2 independents so please give me the example where democrats run a city and its not dangerous especially for black people sharon nielsen death is a normal and inevitable part of the human condition children being prohibited from interacting and playing with their peers is not our childrens wellbeing and future would be a fair trade for my life andi anderson shes voting trump not the sniff you and feel you up joe biden that guys a creep jason matthew ard thats a big brain response right there jeff mclaird you must be like one of the last ten people on earth watching cnn james mulligan snore thats what i call biden was there no one with a pulse that the dems could have put up  robert strangman democrats cities are burning and your still on russia way to keep up with current events lol  tim gelinas absolutely the truth andi anderson have you seen how poorly democrats have run the cities where they have a monopoly on power i dont want that for the rest of the country thats a big no from me democrats are scary so strait republican for the first time ever going strait ticket cy taylor shute you expect food available at the store and gas to fill your vehicle and the electricity to be on are those peoples families not important i dont blame any teacher who doesnt feel safe for not going back our children need to be in school and its time for courage and do whats right our future many of us have had to work through this whole thing with no one worried about our safety why are teachers any different especially considering how important their job is laurel a levesque social interaction with other children parents are expected to work and support their children now you want them to run school when do you expect a single mother to work teachers have an obligation to teach heroes wouldnt hide at home sorry quit if you arent willing some brave young soul will have the courage to teach laurel a levesque i have no voice in the decisions of my employer teaching our children and the social interaction of school is essential just like all the essential jobs that make our lives possible teachers are no more important than anyone else teach our kids in class or get a different job thats the bottom line jenn daigle heather piche you do realize millions of people are working right now and millions are losing their jobs our childrens future is to important to put on hold cindy currie fully open schools for our children and any teacher who doesnt feel safe can resign thats the what needs to be done for their sake heather gigliello at least you care about the important things in life cindy currie ill stick with prioritizing the needs of children first its extremely disturbing how little people care for our future my responsibility is to my children and if the rules for the general public are causing unnecessary harm then im against them children as a group are least at risk and have had to sacrifice the most im getting the feeling that a fair number of the people that support these restrictions are not the ones suffering from the effects of them graduation sports friends they are losing so much cindy currie i prioritize childrens lives over elderly citizens if you think children first is a bad argument in responding to covid your probably focused on yourself and dont care about our children and it seems you are not alone the teachers can quit the health of our children both physically and just as important mentally has to be our societies number one concern they need to go to school and teachers need the courage to teach them thats the bottom line children first i dont have a problem with money going to private school honestly any public school that doesnt open should have all the staff laid off and all the money that is saved given to parents to use to send their kids to a school with teachers who actually have the courage to teach them,3,7.0591,3.6591,65.86,

on others  thats the trump way make fun call names spread hate and discontent when we get rid of the trump the looting of usa will stop typical trump supporter cant beat you with intelligence so they try to baffle you with their bs why i am tired of the hate and discontent he spreads if someone could explain all his lies to the american public i might change my mind wait i have more important things to do then listen to more of his drivel divisiveness nasty foul mouth that spits nothing but hatred what are his promises for the nest 4 years all i have heard is him and his family taking pot shots at biden i know he is going to build a wall wait he failed at that i now he will have a new health plan well he has torn obama care to shreds and has absolutely to put in its place i know he will balance the budget nope he just gave all the big businesss a tax break and put us further into debt i know he will rally america to fight corona virus nope he had that chance and blew it i know he will spread hate and discontent across america yep thats it he is good at that so you approve of the lying you approve trump giving his buddies tax breaks you approve of the racism you approve of him putting people in positions they are unqualified for you approve of the sexual harassment you approve of him giving pardons to criminals that pled guilty you approve of his handling of the corona virus you approve of the doj clearly doing his bidding you approve of him going around the vetting process to get his family secret security clearances and last you agree with him that cnn msnfox cbs abc nbc ny times and many other news outlets around the country give nothing but fake news on him i aint the shiniest penny in the piggy bank but i find it difficult that all these news collaborated together to tell the same lies that he tells he has divided this country too much with his bs i agree with that one for sure nope when obama left office the country was running smoothly he has told so many lies spread so many rumors and in general has split this country in 2 trump came along and said he was going to make america great we are still waiting for america to be great again all he has done is made america worse most definitely sarcasm a few people find me funny so if we all work for free everything will be free doesnt work that way there are a boat load of people making minimum wage here in nh would you want to make 725 an hour and try to live on it  bob willis dont think i want to know how you do or dont know whether biden wears a mask during intimate moments with is wife but i can and do think for myself i saw racism in trump long before he ran for prez he has sexually harassed women for years he has been caught on tape bragging about it he has a proven track record of hiring people not qualified for the job he has a history of circumventing due process in getting his family security clearance when it was advised they not get it he has a proven history of lying to the public i hate wearing a mask but way too many renowned doctors say it is the best thing to do and as our brilliant leader got his medical degree from trump university i have no faith is in any medical advice he gives oh wait he did have that lady from texas that believed in aliens and took advice from her maybe they should cut the minimum wage how dare people try to make a living wage how do they dare ask our compassionate governor for any help they are adults so they should be able to take care of themselves maybe he should cut unemployment while he is at it and maybe welfare that way he could get a bigger and better raise then he would be a true republican we can be proud of vote red and we will have the war trump wants gop followers just refuse to see the hate racism and lies he has spread the totally unqualified people he has put in place to run things they know nothing about start with secretary of education devoss no experience with any of that  now lets look at the post office debacle there is a real winner how about barr in the doj slants everything to make trump look good how about all the lies he has been caught telling how about all the tax cuts he has given all his big business buddies none of that money has trickled down to working person regan proved the trickle down theory was a failure why does refuse to let people testify before congress because all his lies and sneaky things he has done will come out has had a higher turn over in staff than any other president in history but you keep believing him with all the evidence against him he has no respect for women he keeps a few around to make himself look good but he has been heard on tape dissing women but you keep believing that sounds more like the real truth the thousands and thousands being bussed in must be like him winning the popular vote and having the biggest inauguration crow ever i would find trump supporters funny if it werent so serious i made a comment about sununu not standing up to trump when he mentioned the illegal voters being bussed in to nh with no proof one of his supporters commented to me said he saw it with his own eyes so i asked him if he took pics notify the police notify the fbi what kind of busses yellow school ones greyhound type busses get any license plate number or did all he do was call trump himself and report it with no proof never heard back  why didnt you report it to the cops fbi homeland security what did you do call king trump himself and inform him yourself how many pictures did you get any license plate numbers off the buses greyhound or common school buses how did you know they were coming up to vote did you see them any pictures of that either hey sununu if you are for nh ask his highness why he keeps lying about the thousands and thousands of people bussed up from ma to vote against the pied piper you dont challenge on such blatant lie what are the small things that slide under the table jo strohbehn they have no proof i wish i could post a pic here in comments saw a poster that talked about all hitlers lies and then blamed them on the far left sound familiar i would like to know what the republicans think when king trump blatantly lies to the publics face no proof no nothing just a blatant lie i go back to one of his first ones where is the proof thousands and thousands of voter shipped up from ma to vote against him and sununu stands there and doesnt say a word how about the king trump lovers driving their pickups through the crowd hitting people and spraying pepper spray they arent law enforcement theirs your bussed in law breakers not the imaginary ones that king ding dong made up to explain why he lost the popular vote  and sununu doesnt even try to defend nh when the pied piper repeats his lie that we bussed up thousands and thousands of people to vote  here in nh against teflon don i have been reading up on narcissists and lo and behold he was mentioned in many articles i believe what i see he has been caught in so many lies it isnt funny  i am talking about the blatant easily provable lies where is the proof the dems bussed thousands  and thousands of people to nh to vote against to him where is the proof of voter fraud some of his more childish lies are the turnout for the inauguration well mine was bigger than obamas idiotic things like that the last but not least i can tell you are a true republican by telling me i am not to bright that is a trumpism making fun o others that dont agree with you i had another thought watching the news this morning for those of that live in nh where iswas sununu defense of nh when teflon don blatantly lied about thousands and  thousands of voters were bussed up from ma no proof what so ever of this blatant lie repeated again in manchester last night at his airport rally this is the person sununu admires well teflon don lies and the republicans agree with him he has been caught in so many lies it is beyond funny but the gop keeps protecting him and in my mind anyone that looks up to the pied piperteflon don isnt worth much if it wasnt for king ding dongs dividing this country with his racism and poor policies of enriching his friends lying to the public letting his buddies out of jail because likes them appointing people to cabinet positions where they have no knowledge of what to do so yes i am  that one some of his appointees are like making the bread baker in charge running the federal reserves putting a mechanic in charge of surgery at the hospital but you keep believing while so many of king ding dongs lies are proven time and time again by fact checkers i will not change your mind nor will you change mine but in the long run the truth will come out if sununu is a trumpster and thinks he is great we are in worse shape than i thought you would rather have a republican that lies cheats steals denigrates people sexually harasses women is a racist takes credit for others work

my 2 oldest grandkids have completed college and the third oldest is in college nowi dont think it was any easier in the good old days just different  anybody that applies themselves in america can succeed leslie irving my parents had my back until i was 15 then i got my first place a three room cottage in the woods heated by a kerosene stove it was 60 per month at that time i was working 40 hours a week and going to school but i was making 190 per hour but i defrayed some of the cost by working on the place for the landlord leslie irving advantage when i started working minimum wage was 160 but my first job paid 100 per hour cash  i worked 7 hours per night 3 nights per week when i got paid i had to pay one third of my money to my parents for board they demanded that i put one third in a savings account which i couldnt touch and i got to keep one third to spend as frivolously as i wanted corinne provencher well as a former educator in ma for 27 years i have always favored

michael connolly comprehension apparently isnt your long suit cy stewart the churchs charitable role has been usurped by the govt who steals my tax money to redistribute it eric wermers if you put the same energy into bettering yourself instead of moaning about what someone else makes you could do a lot better sheryl petra what i would do first is make more money leslie irving the two are mutually exclusive cy stewart i think 1500 is double minimum wage retired 11 years eric wermers ive lived in nh for 45 years and havent seen that leslie irving issues can be taken up by the national labor

cuts and bring fed income taxes to 28please tell me why democrats are so stupid then they should develop a marketable skill that pays more leslie irving it should have ended after the depression but even still23 percentntogether these 18 million workers with wages at or below the federal minimum made up 23 percent of all hourly paid workers the percentage of hourly paid workers earning the prevailing federal minimum wage or less declined from 27 percent in 2016 to 23 percent in 2017 leslie irving you want to make more make yourself more valuable learn a skill or trade or get more education  leave minimum wage the way it was designedas an entry level training wage no we need more like sununu to counter the democrat communists no please no more communists in nhplease tamsen eldridgewehncke i favor allowing them to whither on the vine aspire higher do something with yourself to be marketable at more than minimum if you are valuable you will be paid as such if you suck at

2138,john maurice you missed all the ma plates at the polling places  sununu is a much better governor than hassan shaheen lynch  stop hating alissa souza  shelly gingras whats dangerous is your addiction to a narrow option that denies choice that parents can provide a better education to their children  you only fear competition because others offer better educational options   larry pilla basic math skills are linda kincaid  and venezuela claims to have a health care system that is available to all  we are surrounded by evidence of a failing educational system  sorry youre so willing to punish our children to sustain a system that is failing them   in review of our conversation it was you that called me narrow absurd labeled fact as rhetoric  choice as discrimination   it is you who discriminate against the many who could  would choose better education by free market principles linda kincaid those conditions you repeatedly demand only support highly paid union officials without helping those the educational system system is supposed to serve     everywhere that school vouchers are available the competition between schools has improved student performance  abilities  especially the poor who struggle with lesser schools until such choices provide greater freedoms  the failing system you defend is faltering  on life support  many graduates struggle at median reading levels math or fail   just imagine graduating with a degree of value that would actually enable that graduate to competitively enter the job market a trade school or college  now theres a future worth the property taxes we all pay with a more prosperous future for our children  grandchildren linda kincaid having to pay twice is not a choice its as tyrannical as the individual mandate  if you think anyone reading our shared conversation agrees that public education has no tuition then youre ignoring how much of our property taxes is used  and it isnt about me   its about choice  those parents who wish can opt into or out of public education  its what the voucher process is all about  empowering we the people to responsibly choose parent educate  raise children according to our values  principles linda kincaid perhaps there is a reasonable balance between the needs of students  those paid to educate them   noting nea demands to defund police endorse a marxist blm or other demands unrelated to education significantly weakens the image of teachers unions  teachers have choices as whether to belong to a union  where they teach  parents should have similar options  linda kincaid having served as counselor steward  vice president in 3 different unions over a 20 year period my opinions are true  factual   the rhetoric is that unions put our children first   linda kincaid my wife  i have contributed our entire lives  i have been involved as a volunteer in education yet without evidence you call me a thief  parents have a right  responsibility to provide the best education to their children   when unions are faring better than our kids its wrong linda kincaid the public option has been perverted by unions that prioritize politics over education  it is only through fair competition that the corruption in education is more exposed  eliminated   linda kincaid your calling people of faith bigots is far more evidence of narrow views than you noted against people who simply want more for their children linda kincaid still providing parents with both the funding to educate their children  the choice of where promotes change as defective systems fail common core has produced a generation that cant make change at a cash register without a machine to compute for them linda kincaid the issue is parental prerogative to determine the education of their children instead of indoctrination  in a nation that spends more on education  gets less for it than other countries the cause is obvious  education has become a political tool  unions no longer serve educators or education  they serve political agendas  it is time to restore local controls  1 education yes  indoctrination non2 apparently it is only righteous for the woke crowd to defund or shun those they disagree with  d of all those whove lectured me nobody has explained the totally dishonest 1619 project that is being forced on an innocent generation  shame linda kincaid fortunately we live in a republic where majority opinions of a mob dont undo law or freedoms many parents do choose to educate their children privately because of the failures of the public option  nationally education is being used for social reengineering in the public option  just as common core has been devalued  is being removed from many systems  now the 1619 project is another waste that falsely tries to rewrite history  guilt the innocent to socialize a free society   parents want real education not political education  larry pilla like the free market competition promotes a better product at a better price elizabeth callahan public monies are from all   only sending money to public schools discriminates against those who disagree with the politics  agenda of unionists  say no to 1619 equal funding  support for all schools provides parents with real choices in educating their children   dont you democrats claim to be pro choice,3,2.75,0.0,100.0,0.0

your  intelligent conversation you poor pathetic loser rotfl  michael barberian and i showed you with facts that you are wrong denial is not a river in egypt you saying im wrong 1000 time over doesnt make it so but if it makes you feel better then more power to you michael barberian its the only official estimate so  yes i suppose that makes it the highest einstein  as if that is to make some point you are also correct your conversation is indeed absurd michael barberian now your just lying you did not refute any numbers its not an insult if its true your comment was dumb and by every measure convd 19 overwhelms the swine flu  michael barberian what highest estimate is that michael barberian i gave you the official numbers but no one knows  for sure sams for swine  flu and influenza neither do you they are best estimates based on available information you started out saying you only cared about facts what happened to that i said your comment was dumb it was fact michael barberian well like i say your claim fell flat using the world wide numbers as well so yes you dont know what you are talking about  michael barberian what a dumb comment good lord for one using what i presume you are attempting to do world wide death tolls covid   virus swine flucovid 19  is an ongoing  pandemic especially in the usa the swine flu is contained we dont know what the world wide ceiling for covid 19 will be but it is clearly going to be untold much higher than it is currently all this even with much greater containment efforts for covid 19 world widefor another the usa death  total for the  swine flu was 16000 compared to 180000 deaths currently for convix 19 the swine flu had a death rate estimate of 02 percent compared to 65 percent for convid 19 even using your lowballed 26 percent figure the death rate for covid 19 overwhelms the swine flu  covid 19 overwhelms the death rate of the swine flu in any measure ngo ahead dig yourself deeper you simply do not know what you are talking about  michael barberian i already did try reading instead of being a smart ass it will do you good michael barberian facts are on my side even your own post but go ahead

big raise but refusing to raise the minimum raise dick masiello i am sure he will vote for trump most of the rich republicans stick together richard honer he has been no help in advising schools about how to open hes been as unhelpful as trump and devos i think sununu is a trump sycophant like trump he referred to the virus as the flu and wasnt going to mandate wearing masks at that rally diane debruyckere thats not true sununu planned to meet trump when he landed at pease afb he wasnt going to the rally because of the virus the rally was cancelled supposedly because of bad weather vincent

here new hampshire is my home vote blue ronald roy what a stupid comment i just said we have not had a deadly pandemic in recent times why would you think i was making light of it jared parr why cant the governor issue guidelines denine foulks having guidelines from the governor is not being dictatorial phil kasiecki the masks are about protecting others unless you have a n95  mask phil kasiecki

cant separate the two richard honer we have never had a deadly pandemic in recent times ginger rojas well since the federal government is helping out the unemployed shouldnt states step in rich

stole from a childrens cancer society oh and another trump and his father were sued for not renting to blacks in nyc winston grady 28 women have accused him of sexual assault a 13yearold girl accused him of raping her she said epstein also raped her she dropped the charges because of death threats also trump has a very creepy relationship with ivanka there are inappropriate photos of both of them

else my opinion should not be silenced i am sorry if i hurt your feelings but what you went through is sad but not the abortion that is part of the roe vs wade argument according to what you say you did not make the choice to terminate your pregcy nature did  what would you have done differently please read my comment completely if you believe life begins at conception than it is protected by the constitution i find it interesting that presently if a woman chooses an abortion it is not murder however if she gets hit by a drunk driver and the baby dies it is murder patty galante kasparian sorry for your loss  patty galante kasparian why would i not laugh they are in no danger of passing the virus to anyone richard dyer i am not sure to which comment you were referring  it is my experience the christian right has lost power most of them have lost their 1st amendment right to freedom of speech but they are the backbone of our country but this is america and all religions and lack of religion are a part of our country we need to blend and use the constitution and mutual laws to make this freedom work sheryl jendrock that is rude he was sharing his experience and opinion the least you can do is respect someone elses opinion and agree to disagree  not call him a name stephanie loupee mine says one should not kill i once thought like you but then i realized the crime of the number of deaths in america i saw the internal pain and guilt suffered by friends who had abortions i believe god cares for each and every soul created i believe he will help the mother to either keep her child or give the child up for adoption we can not promise a happy life for anyone i work with children  even planned children do not live wonderful lives kathleen kent abate if a person believes that life begins at conception than the fetus is protected by the constitution i am confused what does tracking have to do with the covid positive numbers i mean this as an honest question not sarcastically i know they are testing nursing homes regularly and now if people have symptoms or have been exposed they can get tested irene wheeler that is what we the people voted for and want stephanie loupee we will never agree on this because we see life beginning at two different places god bless you kathleen kent abate sorry i believe it is murder so a woman does not have that right  in my opinion caroline cole i sat in an establishment waiting for an exam and spoke with a young woman who was there for an abortion because she and her boyfriend wanted to get married before she got pregt i know woman who have had three and four abortions that is a birth control method pam michael you cant abort a fetus that has died it needs to be removed from the body so it does not cause other problems richard hersom this is rare but is considered self defense a spontaneous abortion or a miscarriage is a naturally occurring loss of a baby the womans body expels the baby in most cases it is not caused by anything the woman has done a doctor may make sure the uterus is empty so she does not get an infectionthis is not the abortion involved in the prolifeprochoice argument pam michael i know someone who is the result of a rape  she is glad to be alive i know a woman whose mother in the 50s was pregt and not married she lost her job she had a great life and her child has made major contributions to the happiness of many people why does a child have to die because of the skins of their parents problem with this is that many women agree with this opinion kathleen kent abate rarely you are right if that same fetus was killed by a drunk driver instead of aborted it would be murder jim tetreault that is the absentee process mail in is sending them to all registered voters then they send them back and some could even vote at the polls so they are double voting i am 100 in agreement with absentee but not mailin people have a choice to go or not nh is opened and has not been restrictive to out of staters i support the pres but will not go because i have a risk factor trump2020 donna zangri sorry i have a few comments i do not know to which one you are referring cecelia gulino lane from the article i read about gov salaries it appears that there is a legal amount they can take some gov have taken none some have reduced their amount sununu chose to take the amount he was allotted by law patricia lacasse high school students make 10 12 dollars and hour in nh eight  i love it when people add facts to these conversations so we can make better judgments thanks look at a covid map of nh there are areas that have experienced minimal cases they do not need masks southern nh needs to use discretion i will admit i laugh when i see people driving alone in a car with a mask on excellent fact joe weeks please stop the kkk stuffyes it exists but neither party supports it the members vote for who they want no one is going after their vote  the 2nd amendment does not require a permit if there were permits in 1776 we would not have a country check where the guns were hidden in durham and concord mass the 2nd amendment is to protect ourselves against the government joe weeks sorry there was no attitude intended just a quick thought joe weeks how is it unfair to the democrats the democrats are in control of our state legislation  joe weeks why is this voter suppression if rules are set that are fair if people are interested enough to vote they know where to register and can follow through it is just a place  i do not understand the argument this is america people should be able to voice their opinions without being called jerks please ad comments that are constructive how is he cheating the state legislature in run by the democrats the lines do not matter for the election of the governor check the state constitution cecelia gulino lane every step just makes it one more thing that could go wrong why not leave it the way it is local control not state control myna proal a couple of thoughts my experience is that the dmv lines are long enough without yet another job many towns do not have dmvs the voter lists are made in the towns  one more thing to get messed up  ellen mcdowell ruggles one of the reasons we are in the mess we are in is that people make generalized rude comments about a specific group instead of looking at the individuals i want people to be color blind i do not want defunding of police open boarders medicare for all that is just a generalized rude comment  if this is true you will never experience the greatest country in the world i hope some changes will be made for equality but some of the other drastic changes will take away your freedom please can you even name 10 of our former governors and 1 thing each did i live in a town where there are a few neighborhoods in which for 10 i could buy ballots easily i may be wrong but i heard you could mail it in or go to the polls  how do they know i mailed it in when i go to vote at the polls he is one of the better public servants in my view i like smaller government i like local rule the governor has been doing what he can to keep nh a locally run state personally in the age of covid with all state budgets being tight why would you pass this legislation now it is going to cost money for a system that may need work but is not broken perhaps in the future but i agree people should not be able to register at the dmv they should register in the town in whihc they are going to vote,3,19.544700000000002,2.6889000000000003,87.91,0.0

2360,roger mckeeman do you have actual statistic that prove that  not sure you are correct  i am only interested in nh statistics nathan page nice explanation but it is flawed by the fact that private schools can discriminate against special needs students nathan page it can be used to pay part of the tuition and you would have to come up with the rest phil kasiecki poor people as you call them do not benefit from the voucher program  the voucher rarely pays the whole tuition poor people can rarely afford the tuition balance so money is taken out of the system that is charged with the education of these students  so in the end vouchers are a detriment to the poor the public money is in fact for the public option  so you are wrong keith macmaster i still believe that the money needs to be used to improve the system that is available to all not bolster the charter schools who discriminate  nothing you can say will ever change my mind on that  public money needs to stay in the public system that provides an education for all and are prohibited from any form of discrimination  my property taxes need to go to bolster the system that is available to all keith macmaster i think the voucher system takes money from the only system that is available to many students vouchers do not cover the whole tuition thus excluding children whose parents cannot pay the balance  they typically do not take special needs students so those children are left in a system that vouchers have taken away its resources to provide an education  if those schools accepted all students regardless of the parents ability to pay will remember that tax money should not be used to support a religious institution separation of church and state and that special needs students of all levels should be accepted if that is where their parents want them to go  you continue to raise parentand educate your children according to your values at home  home is the correct place for values and principles to be taught  it is my belief that sending your children to school to learn what is your responsibility to teach them is really shirking your responsibility keith macmaster you have an option you can send your children where ever you want the public option is without tuition and there are options you can choose at your own expense  no one is taking that choice away from you keith macmaster in my opinion they are not  employees need unions to look out for them  teachers are employees not indentured servants and they need their unions to make sure they are not taken advantage of  they are professionals and deserve to be able to do the job they were educated to do keith macmaster not calling you a thief and your anti union rhetoric is absurd  you do have a right to give your children whatever education you want but i dont have to pay for it keith macmaster i disagree with you and if you think this is so you should be working to improve the system and not stealing funds from the public option  private and charter schools dont have to take special needs children  they dont have to take anyone they dont want to take  public money should not be taken to fund these exclusionary options  when they will take every child who wants to go there without exception then they can have public funds keith macmaster and religious based schools produce bigots and adults that dont know how to be citizens of a diverse society  i still think that public money should be used to improve the public option  if you choose to send your children to private school then you need to pay for it  the money comes from the taxes i pay and i am not interested in ficing a narrow education  my four year old granddaughter can make change and so what if they need to use a calculator keith macmaster i dont know where you live but in nh the schools are mostly funded by local property taxes  the schools are controlled by local school boards  that is local control  private and charter schools escape that control so the should also be excluded from local public funds keith macmaster i disagree with your opinion and i strongly believe that public money be spent on public endeavors  if private schools would take all children tuition free then i might consider that public funds could be used  but as long as those schools discriminate by ability to pay i dont think they have a right to public money  for example there is a catholic school in my community  i am catholic and wanted my children to get a catholic education  i wasnt in the position to pay the tuition so my kids went to public school  my children did not get a political education in school they got that from their very liberal parents  there was no brainwashing being done  no one was rewriting history  my children benefited from attending school with a diverse student body  they learned there was no absolute right way  they were in class with children that looked different and had different beliefs  i am afraid that in our community catholic school it would never have happened  now 27 years later i see the value of a nonrestricted public education  you can involve yourself in school improvement for all schools which would be more productive then posting on facebook keith macmaster children should learn their ethics at home  if you want your children taught that in school then you have the freedom to pay for it  if private schools take public money than they need to use the curricula the public money pays for  i dont want my tax money paying for your children ethical education  and i bet the majority of tax payers feel that way and in a democracy majority rules,3,18.0636,1.7143000000000002,91.33,0.0

school already the centers for disease control and prevention cdc states that of the first 68998 us deaths from covid19 only 12 have been in children under age 14  less than 002 percent nor is coronavirus killing teenagers at last count the fatality total among children under 18 without an underlying condition is one only ten of the 16469 confirmed coronavirus deaths in new york city were among those under the age of 18 thats similar to the fatality rate for those under 20 in france estimated at 0001 percent and in spainnnthe death of even one child is tragic of course yet it must be kept in mind that as many as 600 children in the united states died from seasonal influenza in 201718 according to cdc estimates while the cdcs estimate for covid19 fatalities number just 12 a justreleased jama pediatrics study flatly states our data indicate that children are at far greater risk of critical illness from influenza than from covid19 if the covid19 hazard sets the new standard for health safety the country will need to close its schools each year from november until april to guard against influenzannwhat about the new threat similar to kawasaki disease recently sensationalized as a covid19 association in fact the association is extremely low and the incidence of the disorder is itself rare affecting only 3000 to 5000 children in the united states each year importantly the syndrome is typically treatable and never has been regarded previously as a risk so serious that schools must be shutterednnwhile public attention is focused on exceptional rarities learning is in freefall in boston only half of students are showing up for online instruction on any given day 20 percent of them have never logged on to the designated website this situation is going to be like what is often called the summer slide in student achievement but on steroids says virginias state school superintendent nnlowincome students are suffering the most many lack wifi computer tablets software and other paraphernalia of the affluent nor are they as likely to have access to equivalent mentors at home as those with better educated parents robin lake at the center for reinventing public education says that elementary students in urban districts may have lost 30 percent of their reading skillsnnclosure will endanger the health of our children too already more than half of americas children are not receiving needed vaccinations further schools are the place where many learn that they need glasses or a hearing aid or if seriously ill are guided by the school nurse to the doctors office for prompt medical attentionnnin addition children are being denied opportunities for social and emotional development that come with play exercise sports and socialization reports already indicate that suicide rates among the young are on the increase more certain is the loss in human capital that lasts a lifetime closing schools this past spring translates into a 3 percent or more cut in lifetime earnings for those whose education is being sidelined clearly closing schools does not benefit those whom schools are supposed to serve nnbut what about the adults  the teachers guidance counsellors bus drivers and kitchen staff no one wants to endanger the health of educators but fortunately risks to adults in schools are much less than those encountered in grocery stores pharmacies and other essential businesses as is shown across the world including switzerland canada the netherlands france iceland the uk australia and now ireland children seldom if ever transmit the disease to adults even to their parents several epidemiologists recently denounced the widely cited april publication that erroneously concluded that children can transmit covid19 just as readily as adults its author german virologist christian drosten previously had been featured as a covid19 hero abetting the panic to close schoolsnnno less important covid19 mainly targets the elderly and those with underlying conditions for people under 60 covid19 fatality rates are so low that they are less than or equal to those associated with the seasonal flu according to data from france spain and the netherlands as well as the cdc certainly adults at high risk or who are fearful should take precautions and by now they understand how to socialdistance for their own protection but teaching is a young persons occupation teachers median age is 41 more than 80 percent are under the age of 55 the age at which most become eligible for a retirement pension  nnif opening day should come sooner how should schools open nnunfortunately it is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom that students should be asked to attend halfdays wear masks skip recess spread themselves six feet apart and spend half their time in front of a computer  all in the name of social distancing but how can classrooms hold students spread apart by six feet how can you practice phonics with your mouth covered how can you learn if it is time to return home just as you have settled into your seat how can you develop socially and emotionally if you must remain distant from friends at recess how can teachers instruct with masks on their faces nnall of this borders on the absurd when we now know that social distancing and face coverings for children are completely unnecessary nnnever have schools subjected children to such an unhealthy uncomfortable and antieducational environment so science cannot precisely define the total harm it will cause but science does tell us that risks from covid19 are too minimal to sacrifice the educational social emotional and physical wellbeing  to say nothing of the very health  of our young people   nnscott w atlas md is a physician and the david and joan

the left gets their way and gets to keep importing foreign workers left and right especially lessskilled ones it will keep driving those wages down because there will be readily available replacements at those wages so what jeff rich is telling us is he doesnt care about facts which is how leftists roll especially when the facts blow up an article of faith on the left like this liz calder should

for those who cant afford it theres public education  you have laid bare right there that you want only the bestoff to have a choice for where to send their kids to school you want the poorest families to not have the same choice linda kincaid a whole lot of them have benefited from it in the nations capital with the dc opportunity scholarship program as one example in fact over 80 percent

the same choice yet they purport to be champions of the poornnits also worth noting that people of color are disproportionately represented among the lower economic classes and yet these same people

facts of what i am advocating and unlike what you and the left advocate there is proof that what i advocate works right in front of us in fact prior to the pandemic most of the biggest rises in wages were seen by the little guys contrary to popular liberal belief for example wages have soared since trump took office with median household income up over 5000 compared to barely 1000 over obamas 8 years and less than half that under george w bush a big government republican hardly a conservativennill leave you with this and a summary of what it says that shows the lefts rank dishonesty and aversion to facts  httpswwwfrbatlantaorgchcswagegrowthtrackeraspxnn when it comes to race wage growth for whites was a tick behind at 35 percent while nonwhites charged ahead at 43 percentn in terms of age the young and the restless rule those ages 16 to 24 saw wages climb 84 percent americans 25 to 54 enjoyed 39 percent higher paychecks and the typically higherincome 55plus crowd was behind the curve with 25 percent wage growthn bachelors degrees generated 37 percent wage boosts for those who held them but those who went no further than highschool graduation also savored 37 percent higher pay those with associate degrees saw their checks grow just 32 percentn while those in fice and business services scored 41 percent higher salaries workers in manufacturing construction and mining were in a photo finish with them at 40 percentn while job stayers earned 32 percent more money job switchers scored an extra 43 percentn interestingly enough those with low medium and high skills all shared 36 percent wage increases matching the nationwide bonus laurel dean why would you want to live somewhere that you can only complain about you may have a right to live here but what kind of life

that whiny leftists play leslie coughlin i guess you missed where aoc and others but aoc most prominently got that one wrongnnmore importantly the phenomenon of multiple jobholding itself is not widespread  as the chart below shows multiple jobholding has been associated with periods of both high and low unemployment over the period for which bls collects data multiple jobholding peaked between 1995 and 1996 62 percent of the population at which point the official unemployment rate u3 averaged 55 percent over the course of the great recession 52 percent of the population held multiple jobs during which the official unemployment rate jumped to 93 percent since then the multiple jobholding rate has continually declined as of 2017 it was 49 percent  trends also appear uncorrelated with the u6 rate which captures involuntary parttime workers workers who work parttime but do so for economic reasons and would rather work fulltime irrespective of the unemployment rate the longrun multiple jobholding rate is decliningnnhttpswwwforbescomsitesaparnamathur20190804aremostpeopleactuallyworkingtwoorthreejobsnotreally32edf7024a56 jeff rich if you want minimum wage to be something people can live on then you should advocate lower taxes and reducing the size scope and power of the government the cost of laws and regulations is baked into the price of all the goods and services we consume to the tune of well over 10000 per person per year and the single biggest expense for americans nowadays is taxes  not the mortgage not health care but taxes those costs would go

improve themselves or maine or vermont especially if they want to whine about property taxes since those are lower in those states but the overall tax burden in those states is much higher  two of the top four in the country behind new york and hawaii john barrett you improve yourself to create more value and thus get a job that pays more no one has only the ability to graduate high school  they might have only the mindset or desire to do that but no ones ability is that limited i bet your dollar goes a bit further here than it would in other states making a certain amount of money in san francisco is a wee bit different than making the same amount of money in say alabama marion cone considering a tiny percentage of people are trying to live on those wages the case for raising it from that standpoint  without considerations of the other effects like how it would lead to jobs lostnot added in the first place or higher prices  is lacking kenneth lawrence i always put this challenge out to leftists who try to claim its so easy to pay their idea of what the wage should be and make boatloads of money then the excuses and dodges follow if its as easy as they claim why in the world arent they doing it they could be set for life moneywise and do the ultimate virtue signaling while theyre at it and what could be better for a leftist well other than perhaps redistributing any money

3555,its a false claim on raising minimum wage and it has to do with just one thing record corporate profits  however small business can be adversely impacted but many already have had to raise their wages  i always calibrate to my own experience  when i worked for hanford brothers between 1980 and 1988 by 1988 i made almost 10 bucks an hour  so that is 32 years ago  the fact that the minimum wage remains below that amount 32 years ago despite massive inflation an apartment in san francisco 2 bedroom in 1990 cost me and my roommate 800 per month  that same apartment is 3000 dollars today  pretty simple to see the problem  the owner class is living in multiple homes has plenty and despises and disrespects the workers that allow them that lifestyle  this is a class war and its only a matter of time until the peasants  reference to precolonial times rise up and hang the rich and burn their homes  dont be stupid raise the minimum wage even the minimum is not a livable wage in nh at 40 hours per week,2,0.75,0.0,100.0,0.0

or guys with big trucks and gun racks who you have to worry if theyre going to snap from road rage and kill everybody on the road who the hell is treading on you the rest of us want to get as far away from you as possible  jack shannon trump is ruining the country and you still dont get it  you guys call democrats socialists but you support someone in bed with russia right in front of your eyes even been proven by a republican committee  still you deny  you guys are the real traitors unless you are a troll from russia and then i probably complemented you we all need to be there on november 3rd this destruction of america and what it stands for needs to end now vote for joe like your country depends on it because it does suzanne mckinnon looked pretty competent during the town hall last night  especially liked when he called trump out for being a disgrace to the office and his lack of leadership  as old as joe is hes still a better man than that lying weasel  brandon holm thats funny just watched some of the town hall with biden  no teleprompter  and guess what sounded pretty awake to me and more like a leader who cares about everybody  unlike trump who only cares about trump karl anderson fear mongering anyone carol dow mcdougall half of them are russian trolls thats their job pauline decato yeah i did that with some of trumps signs they worked great ill get some more now so my fire will be great again  karla causer so youre saying youre into lying and repeating talking points to defend your man trump im a moderate democrat that believes in bipartisanship to solve problems  you seem to like division of america and fighting and yelling to solve our problems  how about some real answers instead of made up conspiracies  conservatism is the antidote to tyranny i would think possibly dying is a good reason to be afraid  however  if you practice thr 3 protocols most will be fine  republicans love the fearmongering talking point do you ever get tired of repeating the same bullshit why dont you try helping with the problem instead of making it worse we all want this to be over all nonmaskers do is prolong the agony  think you guys like it as much as conspiracy theories  ginger rojas now youre denying that republicans like to hoard guns why else would you be worried about the second amendment abortions and dont take my guns is the rights mottos  nobody wants your stupid guns but we often wonder what your planning with an arsenal hidden in your bunker  just expect the worse   karla causer then maybe you should smoke  might realize that what you accuse the left of is exactly what the right is doing helen mahoney yet they flip out cause pelosi didnt wear her mask to an appointment  why didnt the shop owner tell her to put it on was a setup thats why wanted to sell the footage to fox news  ginger rojas seriously  trump can shoot somebody in the street and youd vote for him oh yeah so would you guys with all the guns  karla causer the truth of hannity and carlson wow now thats some good pot youre on dan daigle everytime trump improvises he looks like he has more dementia than joe just drifts off into a psychosis speech needs another competency test  ralph racer see above  carl daniels its spreading like the virus  lie repeat lie repeat  facts for trumpians  richard bartlett lets get pot legalized  not going to happen while hes in office  he wouldnt go against his master trump  yes donald  yes donald  shawn faucher totally agree  somehow we have to stop this shit  we are 2 different groups of people being pushed to fight each other  conspiracies and insults arent helping anything   ralph russell if im wrong then whyis he doing away with intelligence briefings about election interference once a cheater always a cheater ask all his ex wives  just because there was no written  proof doesnt mean he wasnt welcoming the election interference  and if anyones a puppet hes putins and youre his not very hard to see ralph russell you are referring to the original investigation with mueller  this was a recent investigation by a bipartisan committee  it says while no verbal agreement was found to be found he also welcomed the assistance from the russians  his campaign advisers were easily manipulated and also welcomed the interference  how convenient of you to mention only part of the article yhere is also more evidence of interference in the 2020 election  is it possible for this man to win a fair election thats what there is no evidence of  donna clark i dont mean you i meant if someone who goes to the polls and doesnt know all the candidates in all positions then just vote a straight ticket  i thought about voting sununu for a while there but he dropped the ball with a few mistakes in judgement lately  think its time for a change  ralph russell httpswwwgooglecomampswwwnytimescom20200818uspoliticssenateintelligencerussianinterferencereportamphtml  nni just noticed your statement that the russian interference was a hoax  heres a link to show a republican committee   nfound interference in the 2016 election between russia and the us just had to correct youit wasnt a hoax just another reason trump shouldnt be in office  just saying  more cheating to come  donna clark hope youre right will vote blue on my ballot just because i know red isnt for most people who care about others if you dont know just vote a straight democratic ticket  donna clark seems like for local elections people get reelected from name recognition alone think many will vote for him on that alone  him being john sununus kid doesnt help  tricia bradford wouldnt expect you to get it whatever i can stick up for somebody if i want just like you can insult them donna has been around spewing her bs and should have somebody refute her crazy shit enough with the conspiracies  tricia bradford typical trump supporter just insults and stupid memes  hes someone with a different point of view than yours i know this is hard try acting like an adult once in a while   donna clark you can only stray so far from the domice and fear of trumps retaliation if he does anything resembling against trumps policies   earle whitney are you qanon or russian same old shit i hear from the russians  kind of hard to know  kathy lapointe really fed up with that do nothing bs why dont you talk to mitch mcconnell about why nothing gets done in congress  his desk is where bills go to die  the whole obama presidency was stalled due to republicans stopping everything that he tried to pass surprised he even got affordable care to pass now trump wants to do away with that before implementing anything during a pandemic so why dont you label the republican congress as do nothing  and get it right
